    <h1>3.1 Chemical measurements, conservation of mass and the quantitative interpretation of chemical equations</h1>
    <h2>3.1.1 Conservation of mass and balanced chemical equations</h2>
    <p>
        - <b>The law of conservation of mass</b> states that no atoms are lost or made during a
        chemical reaction, therefore the mass of the product equals the mass of the reactants.<br>
        - This means that chemical reactions can be represented by symbol
        equations which are balanced in terms of the numbers of atoms of
        each element involved on both sides of the equation.
    </p>
    <h3>Simple example of balancing equations</h3>
    <p>
        <b>Example 1:</b> Balance the equation for the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen to form water.<br>
        Unbalanced:  H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> → H<sub>2</sub>O
    </p>
    <p>
        Step 1: Count the number of atoms on each side.<br>
        - Left side: 2 H, 2 O<br>
        - Right side: 2 H, 1 O
    </p>
    <p>
        Step 2: Balance oxygen by putting a 2 in front of H<sub>2</sub>O:<br>
        H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> → 2H<sub>2</sub>O
    </p>
    <p>
        Step 3: Now hydrogen is unbalanced (4 on right, 2 on left). Add a 2 in front of H<sub>2</sub>:<br>
        2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> → 2H<sub>2</sub>O
    </p>
    <p>
        ✔ Balanced equation: <b>2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> → 2H<sub>2</sub>O</b>
    </p>
    <h2>3.1.2 Relative formula mass</h2>
    <p>
        - The relative formula mass or M<sub>r</sub> of a compound is the sum of the
        relative atomic masses (A<sub>r</sub>s) of the atoms in the numbers shown in the formula.<br>
        - For example, the relative formula mass of water (H<sub>2</sub>O) is 2 * H (1) + 1 * O (16) = 
        2 + 16 = 18.<br>
        - In a balanced chemical equation, the sum of the relative formula
        masses of the reactants in the quantities shown equals the sum of
        the relative formula masses of the products in the quantities shown.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Demonstration of relative formula mass with balanced equations</h3>
    <p>
        For example (formula for photosynthesis):<br>
        6CO<sub>2</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>O → C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 6O<sub>2</sub><br>
        - M<sub>r</sub> of carbon dioxide = 1 * C (12) + 2 * O (16) = 12 + 32 = 44.<br>
        - Account for the six carbon dioxide molecules: 44 * 6 = 264.<br>
        - M<sub>r</sub> of water = 2 * H (1) + 1 * O (16) = 2 + 16 = 18.<br>
        - Account for the six water molecules: 18 * 6 = 108.<br>
        - Total M<sub>r</sub> of reactants = <b>264 + 108 = 372</b>.<br>
        - M<sub>r</sub> of glucose = 6 * C (12) + 12 * H (1) + 6 * O (16) = 72 + 12 + 96 = 180.<br>
        - M<sub>r</sub> of oxygen = 2 * O (16) = 32.<br>
        - Accounting for the six oxygen molcules: 32 * 6 = 192.<br>
        - Total M<sub>r</sub> of products = <b>180 + 192 = 372</b>.<br>
        - As this is a balanced equation, <b>M<sub>r</sub> of reactants = M<sub>r</sub> of products</b>.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Demonstration: Percentage by mass in a compound</h3>
    <p>
        To find the percentage by mass of an element in a compound:<br>
        1) Calculate the compound’s relative formula mass (M<sub>r</sub>).<br>
        2) Find the total mass contributed by the element of interest.<br>
        3) Use: <b>% by mass = (mass of that element in the formula ÷ M<sub>r</sub>) × 100</b>.<br>
    </p>
    <h4>Example 1: H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (sulfuric acid)</h4>
    <p>
        Using A<sub>r</sub> values: H = 1, S = 32, O = 16<br>
        - M<sub>r</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) = (2 × 1) + 32 + (4 × 16) = 2 + 32 + 64 = <b>98</b>.<br>
        - Mass from H = 2 × 1 = 2 → %H = (2 ÷ 98) × 100 ≈ <b>2.0%</b>.<br>
        - Mass from S = 32 → %S = (32 ÷ 98) × 100 ≈ <b>32.7%</b>.<br>
        - Mass from O = 4 × 16 = 64 → %O = (64 ÷ 98) × 100 ≈ <b>65.3%</b>.<br>
        - Check: 2.0 + 32.7 + 65.3 ≈ <b>100%</b> (allowing for rounding).<br>
    </p>
    <h4>Example 2: CaCO<sub>3</sub> (calcium carbonate)</h4>
    <p>
        Using A<sub>r</sub>: Ca = 40, C = 12, O = 16<br>
        - M<sub>r</sub>(CaCO<sub>3</sub>) = 40 + 12 + (3 × 16) = 40 + 12 + 48 = <b>100</b>.<br>
        - %Ca = (40 ÷ 100) × 100 = <b>40%</b>.<br>
        - %C = (12 ÷ 100) × 100 = <b>12%</b>.<br>
        - %O = (48 ÷ 100) × 100 = <b>48%</b>.<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>3.1.3 Mass changes when a reactant or product is a gas</h2>
    <p>
        - Some reactions may appear to involve a change in mass but this
        can usually be explained because a reactant or product is a gas
        and its mass has not been taken into account.<br>
        - For example, when a metal reacts with oxygen the mass of the oxide 
        produced is greater than the mass of the metal. This is because the 
        oxygen has come from the air, and the metal is the same mass as it was before,
        and oxide mass = metal mass + oxygen mass.<br>
        - In the thermal decompositions of metal carbonates carbon dioxide is 
        produced and escapes into the atmosphere leaving the metal oxide as 
        the only solid product. The mass of the carbon dioxide is removed from the 
        metal carbonate, and metal carbonate mass = metal mass - carbon dioxide mass.
    </p>
    <h3>Explaining observed changes in mass</h3>
    <p>
        - You may be given a question in the exam which asks you to explain why mass 
        increased or decreased in a reaction (with the question of course wanting you to
        cite the above as the reason).<br>
        - The question will contain a balanced chemical equation, for example 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.<br>
        - Here, mass will be gained from the oxygen and become part of the copper oxide.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>3.1.4 Chemical measurements</h2>
    <p>
        - Whenever a measurement is made there is always some uncertainty about 
        the result obtained; nothing is completely accurate.<br>
        - An <b>error</b> refers to the difference between a measured 
        or estimated value and the true value of a quantity.<br>
        - There are two types of errors: <b>systematic error</b> and <b>random error</b>.
    </p>
    <h3>Random errors</h3>
    <p>
        - In a random error, there is an equal chance the value is too high or too low.<br>
        - Random errors at GCSE are most likely to be caused by:
        <ul>
            <li>Misreading the instrument</li>
            <li>Random changes in the environment, such as temperature or humidity</li>
            <li>Slight errors in the manufacture of the instrument</li>
            <li>Using a slightly wrong amount of a substance</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Systematic errors</h3>
    <p>
        - In a systematic error, the value will always be too high or too low no matter how many times 
        the experiment is repeated.<br>
        - This is because they are errors in the experimental procedure itself.<br>
        - Systematic errors at GCSE are most likely to be caused by:
        <ul>
            <li>Not calibrating the instrument properly</li>
            <li>Misreading the instrument the same way every time</li>
            <li>Using the wrong amount of a substance every time</li>
            <li>Not setting up the experiment properly</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Measuring uncertainty</h3>
    <p>
        - <b>Uncertainty</b> tells us how confident we can be in a measurement.  
        It is not the same as an error, but instead describes the range of values within which 
        the true result is likely to lie.<br>
        - At GCSE, there are three main ways to measure uncertainty:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Resolution of the instrument</b>: The uncertainty is often taken as half the smallest scale division of the measuring instrument.  
                For example, a thermometer with 1 °C divisions has an uncertainty of ±0.5 °C.</li>
            <li><b>Range of repeated measurements</b>: If you repeat an experiment several times, the uncertainty can be estimated as half the range of the measured values.  
                For example, if you record 20.1 g, 20.3 g, and 20.2 g, the range is 0.2 g, so the uncertainty is ±0.1 g.</li>
            <li><b>Percentage uncertainty</b>: To compare uncertainties between different measurements, express the uncertainty as a percentage of the measured value:  
                <br><code>percentage uncertainty = (uncertainty ÷ measured value) × 100%</code></li>
        </ul>
        - To reduce uncertainty, you can take more measurements and calculate a mean, use more precise instruments, or improve the experimental method.

    <h1>2.3 Structure and bonding of carbon</h1>
    <h2>2.3.1 Diamond</h2>
    <p>
        - Diamond and carbon are <abbr title="(one of the different forms of a chemical element that can exist in the same physical state)">allotropes</abbr> of carbon.<br>
        - In diamond, each carbon atom forms four covalent bonds with other carbon atoms in a giant covalent structure, called a tetrahedron.<br>
        - Diamond is very hard due to its covalent bonds.<br>
        - It also has a very high melting point and does not conduct electricity.
    </p>
    <h2>2.3.2 Graphite</h2>
    <p>
        - In graphite, each carbon atom forms three covelant bonds with other carbon atoms forming layers of hexagonal rings.<br>
        - These layers of hexagonal rings have no covelant bonds with other layers. This makes graphite soft as the layers can 
        slide over each other, despite the strong covelant bonds between the carbon atoms.<br>
        - This bonding structure also delocalises one electron from each carbon atom, making it similar to metals.

                    This delocalisation of electrons makes graphite a good conductor of electricity as electrons are free to 
                    pass through the material.</td>

                <td>Graphite is arranged in layers with only weak intermolecular forces holding them together, despite the strong
                    covelant bonds between the carbon atoms. Therefore, the layers can slide over each other easily, and this makes 
                    graphite slippery. An example of this can be seen in pencils &ndash; graphite easily transferrs from pencil to paper
                    and breaks free from the rest of the pencil.</td>

    <h2>2.3.3 Graphene and fullerenes (and carbon nanotubes)</h2>
    <h3>Graphene</h3>
    <p>
        - Graphene is simply a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice &ndash; a single layer of graphite.<br>
        - It is the thinnest material used today, and is commonly used in electronics, in biomedical equipment, and for forming composite materials 
        (materials that are made from two or more combined materials).

    <h3>Fullerenes</h3>
    <p>
        - Fullerenes are molecules of carbon atoms with hollow shapes/tubes.<br>
        - Their structure is based on hexagonal rings of carbon atoms, however they may also contain rings 
        with five or seven carbon atoms.<br>
        - The first fullerene to be discovered was Buckminsterfullerene (or "bucky ball") (C<sub>60</sub>) which has a spherical shape:

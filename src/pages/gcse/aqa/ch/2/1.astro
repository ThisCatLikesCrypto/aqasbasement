    <h1>2.1 - Bonding, structure, and the properties of matter</h1>
    <h2>2.1.1 Chemical bonds</h2>
    <p>
        - There are three types of strong chemical bonds: ionic, covalent and
        metallic.<br>
        - In Ionic bonds, the positive and negative charges are attracted to each
        other. It can only occur in compounds where metals are combined with non-metals.<br>
        - In Covalent bonds, the electrons are shared between the atoms. It happens 
        in most non-metallic elements and in most non-metal compounds.<br>
        - In Metallic bonds, the electrons are shared between the atoms, but the
        atoms are held together by a network of metal ions. It occurs in metals.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>2.1.2 Ionic bonds</h2>
    <p>
        - Ions are atoms that have a positive or negative charge formed by the 
        gain or loss of electrons.<br>
        - The loss or gain of electrons gives the ion a full outer shell of electrons.<br>
        - A full outer shell needs to have 8 electrons. Metals lose electrons, and 
        non-metals gain electrons.<br>
        - Since most of GCSE only focuses up to Calcium, for our purposes:
        <ul>
            <li>Group 1 elements lose 1 electron</li>
            <li>Group 2 elements lose 2 electrons</li>
            <li>Group 3 elements lose 3 electrons</li>
            <li>Group 4 elements gain 4 electrons</li>
            <li>Group 5 elements gain 3 electrons</li>
            <li>Group 6 elements gain 2 electrons</li>
            <li>Group 7 elements gain 1 electron</li>
            <li>Group 8 elements do not gain or lose electrons</li>
        </ul><br>
        - Negative ions are called anions and form when atoms gain electrons, 
        they have more electrons than protons.<br>
        - Positive ions are called cations and form when atoms lose electrons, 
        they have more protons than electrons.<br>

    <h2>2.1.3 Ionic Structures</h2>
    <h3>Giant Ionic Lattices</h3>
    <p>
        - This is a regular arrangement of alternating positive and negative ions.<br>
        - The ions are tightly packed together, and the electrons are evenly distributed.<br>
        - It is held together by the strong electrostatic forces of attraction between the ions, forming
        the basis of ionic bonding.<br>
        - Due to the electrostatic forces, the lattice structures have high melting and boiling points.<br>
        - They allow regular shaped crystals to be formed.

    <h2>2.1.4 Covalent bonding</h2>
    <p>
        <sub>(images from spec)</sub><br>
        - When atoms share pairs of electrons, they form strong covalent bonds.<br>
        - Covalently bonded substances may consist of small molecules, for example water (H<sub>2</sub>O).<br>
        - However, some covalently bonded substances have very large molecules, such as polymers, for example 
        polyethylene (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>).<br>
        - In addition, some covalently bonded substances have giant covalent structures, such as diamond and silicon dioxide.
    </p>
    <h3>Representing covalent bonds</h3>

        - The covalent bonds in molecules and giant structures can be represented in the following forms:

    <h2>2.1.5 Metallic bonding</h2>
    <p>
        - Metals consist of giant structures of atoms arranged in a regular pattern.<br>
        - The electrons in the outer shell of metal atoms are <b>delocalised</b> and
        so are free to move through the whole structure, which results strong metallic bonds 
        in the form of giant structures (lattices).

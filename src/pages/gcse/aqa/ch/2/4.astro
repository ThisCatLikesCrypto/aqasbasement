    <h2>2.4.1 Sizes of particles and their properties</h2>
    <p>
        - Nanoparticles are structures that are 1&ndash;100 nm in size, of the order
        of a few hundred atoms.<br>
        - They are smaller than fine particles (PM<sub>2.5</sub>). Fine particles are particles with diameters
        between 100 and 2500 nm, and are commonly referred to as "particulates" in a pollution context.<br>
        - Coarse particles (PM<sub>10</sub>) have diameters between 1 &times; 10<sup>-5</sup> m and 2.5 &times;
        10<sup>-6</sup> m.
        Coarse particles are often referred to as dust.

            <td>100 &ndash; 2500 nm (0.1 &ndash; 2.5 &mu;m)</td>

            <td>2.5 &ndash; 10 &mu;m (2.5 &times; 10<sup>-6</sup> m to 1 &times; 10<sup>-5</sup> m)</td>
            <td>Dust, pollen</td>

    <h3>Surface area to volume ratio</h3>
    <p>
        - The surface area to volume ratio (SA:V) becomes larger as the size of the particle decreases.<br>
        - For a cube of side length <em>L</em>:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Surface area = 6L<sup>2</sup></li>
        <li>Volume = L<sup>3</sup></li>
        <li>SA:V ratio = 6 / L</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This means that nanoparticles, being extremely small, have a much greater SA:V ratio compared to bulk material.
        A large surface area relative to volume makes them highly reactive and useful for applications such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Catalysts (faster reactions due to more exposed surface)</li>
        <li>Drug delivery (large surface area for interaction with cells)</li>
        <li>Cosmetics and sunscreens (better coverage and absorption of UV light)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Worked example: SA:V for cubes at different scales</h4>
    <Table>
        <tr>
            <th>Object</th>
            <th>Side length, L (m)</th>
            <th>Surface area, 6L<sup>2</sup> (m<sup>2</sup>)</th>
            <th>Volume, L<sup>3</sup> (m<sup>3</sup>)</th>
            <th>SA:V, 6/L (m<sup>-1</sup>)</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1&nbsp;cm cube</td>
            <td>1.0 &times; 10<sup>-2</sup></td>
            <td>6.0 &times; 10<sup>-4</sup></td>
            <td>1.0 &times; 10<sup>-6</sup></td>
            <td>6.0 &times; 10<sup>2</sup></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>10&nbsp;nm cube</td>
            <td>1.0 &times; 10<sup>-8</sup></td>
            <td>6.0 &times; 10<sup>-16</sup></td>
            <td>1.0 &times; 10<sup>-24</sup></td>
            <td>6.0 &times; 10<sup>8</sup></td>
        </tr>
    </Table>
    <p>
        Moving from a 1&nbsp;cm cube to a 10&nbsp;nm cube increases SA:V by a factor of
        10<sup>6</sup> (one million), because SA:V scales as 1/&thinsp;L.

    <h2>2.4.2 Uses of nanoparticles</h2>
    <p>
        - Nanoparticles have many applications in medicine, in electronics, in cosmetics 
        and sun creams, as deodorants, and as catalysts.<br>
        - New applications of nanoparticles is an important area of research.

    <h1>Chemistry 6.1 Rate of reaction</h1>
    <h2>6.1.1 Calculating rates of reactions</h2>
    <p>
        The rate of a chemical reaction can be found by measuring the
        quantity of a reactant used or the quantity of product formed over
        time:
    </p>
    <img class="centreimage" src="/images/ch/rateofreaction.png" alt="Rate of reaction equations">
    <p>
        - The quantity of reactant or product can be measured by the mass in
        grams, moles, or by a volume in cm<sup>3</sup>.<br>
        - The units of rate of reaction maybe given as g/s, mol/s, or cm<sup>3</sup>/s
    </p>
    <h3>Example Calculations</h3>
    <p><b>Example 1:</b> Calculate the rate of reaction for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) into water (H₂O) and oxygen (O₂).</p>
    <p><b>Chemical equation (balanced):</b> 2 H₂O₂ → 2 H₂O + O₂</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>What is being measured?</b> The quantity of reactant used: 0.5 mol of H₂O₂ decomposes.</li>
        <li><b>Time interval:</b> 10 s.</li>
        <li><b>Formula:</b> rate = (quantity of reactant used or product formed) / (time taken).</li>
        <li><b>Substitute the values:</b><br>
            rate = 0.5 mol / 10 s
        </li>
        <li><b>Do the division:</b><br>
            rate = 0.05 mol/s
        </li>
        <li><b>Units and interpretation:</b> The rate is 0.05 mol s⁻¹. This means on average 0.05 moles of H₂O₂ are consumed each second over the measured period.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><b>Example 2:</b> Calculate the rate of reaction for the formation of ammonia (NH₃) from nitrogen (N₂) and hydrogen (H₂). Give the rate in g/s and also show the equivalent in mol/s.</p>
    <p><b>Chemical equation (balanced):</b> N₂ + 3 H₂ → 2 NH₃</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>What is being measured?</b> The quantity of product formed: 34.0 g of NH₃ (measured mass).</li>
        <li><b>Time interval:</b> 20 s.</li>
        <li><b>Rate in g/s (direct):</b><br>
            rate = mass of product / time = 34.0 g / 20 s = 1.7 g/s.
        </li>
        <li><b>Units and interpretation:</b> The reaction produces 1.7 grams of NH₃ each second on average during the measured period.</li>
        <li><b>Optional — convert to mol/s:</b><br>
            Molar mass of NH₃ = 14.01 (N) + 3×1.008 (H) ≈ 17.03 g/mol.<br>
            Moles of NH₃ formed = 34.0 g ÷ 17.03 g/mol ≈ 1.997 mol ≈ 2.00 mol (to three significant figures).<br>
            rate in mol/s = 2.00 mol / 20 s = 0.100 mol/s.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>6.1.3 Collision theory and activation energy</h2>
    <p>
        - Collision theory states that chemical reactions can occur only when reacting 
        particles collide with each other and with sufficient energy.<br>
        - The minimum amount of energy that particles must have to react is called 
        the activation energy.<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>6.1.4 Catalysts</h2>
    <p>
        - Catalysts, while increasing the rate of a reaction, but are <b>not</b> used 
        up during the reaction.<br>
        - This means that the catalyst is still there, unchanged, after the reaction.<br>
        - Different reactions need different catalysts.<br>
        - An example of a catalyst is enzymes in biological systems.<br>
        - Catalysts increase the rate of reaction by providing <b>a different
        pathway for the reaction that has a lower activation energy</b>.

    <img class="centreimagefullwidth" src="/images/ch/catalystsdiagram.png" alt="Catalysis energy profile diagram">
    <p>
        - According to <b>collision theory</b>, a catalyst lowers the activation energy so 
        a greater proportion of collisions result in a successful reaction.<br>
        - The frequency of collisions remains the same.

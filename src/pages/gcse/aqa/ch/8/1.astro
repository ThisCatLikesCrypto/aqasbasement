    <h1>8.1 Purity, formulations and chromatography</h1>
    <h2>8.1.1 Pure Substances</h2>
    <p>
        - In chemistry, a pure substance is a single element or compound not
        mixed with any other substance.<br />
        - In science we would not refer to a substance such as milk as pure because
        it is a mixture of a number of different substances. This is different from
        everyday language, where a pure substance can mean a substance that has had
        nothing added to it, so it is unadulterated and in its natural state, eg
        pure milk.
    </p>
    <h3>Identifying Pure/Impure Substances</h3>
    <p>
        - Pure substances have specific melting and boiling points. These can be
        used to distinguish pure substances from impure substances.<br />

                <tr>
                    <th>Substance</th>
                    <th>Melting point (Â°C)</th>

    <h2>8.1.2 Formulations</h2>
    <p>
        - A formulation is a mixture that has been designed as a useful product.
        Many products are complex mixtures in which each chemical has a
        particular purpose<br />
        - Formulations are made by mixing the components in carefully measured quantities
        to ensure that the product has the required properties.<br />
        - Formulations include fuels, cleaning agents, paints, medicines, alloys,
        fertilisers, and foods.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>8.1.3 Chromatography</h2>
    <p>
        - Chromatography can be used to separate mixtures and can give
        information to help identify substances.<br />
        - It involves a stationary phase and a mobile phase.<br />
        <ul>
            <li>The stationary phase is the paper</li>
            <li>The mobile phase is the solvent (water)</li>
        </ul>
        - The ratio of the distance moved by a compound (centre of spot from origin)
        can be expressed as its R<sub>f</sub> value (retention factor).<br />
        <img

            alt="Chromatography Rf Equation"
        />
        - If a pigment does not travel very fast, it will <b>not</b> travel far up
        the paper and have a lower R<sub>f</sub> value.<br />
        - The pigment could have a strong attraction to the stationary phase (with
        strong intermolecular forces) and/or a weak attraction to the mobile phase.<br
        />
        - If a pigment <i>does</i> travel quite fast, it will travel further up the
        paper and have a higher R<sub>f</sub> value.<br />
        - The pigment could have a weak attraction to the stationary phase (with
        weak intermolecular forces) and/or a strong attraction to the mobile phase.<br
        />
        - This means that different compounds have different R<sub>f</sub> values
        in different solvents, which can be used to help identify the compounds.
    </p>
    <h3>Chromatography Experiment</h3>
    <p>
        <img

        />
        - The black dot is a mixture, because it separates out into multiple colours.<br
        />
        - Yellow is likely to have the strongest attraction to the stationary phase,
        as it travelled the least.<br />
        - Blue is likely to have the strongest attraction to the mobile phase, as
        it travelled the most.<br />
    </p>
    <h4>R<sub>f</sub> Calculation</h4>
    <p>
        - The solvent front is 10.5cm from the starting line.<br />
        - Yellow is 2cm from the starting line.<br />
        - Purple is 6.5cm from the starting line.<br />
        - Blue is 9cm from the starting line.<br />
        - <b>Using the R<sub>f</sub> equation:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Yellow: R<sub>f</sub> = 2/10.5 = 0.19</li>
            <li>Purple: R<sub>f</sub> = 6.5/10.5 = 0.62</li>
            <li>Blue: R<sub>f</sub> = 9/10.5 = 0.86</li>
        </ul>

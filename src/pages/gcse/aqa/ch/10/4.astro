    <h1>10.4 The Haber process and the use of NPK fertilisers</h1>
    <h2>10.4.1 The Haber process</h2>
    <p>
        - The Haber process manufactures ammonia for nitrogen-based fertilisers by combining nitrogen from the air and 
        hydrogen, typically derived from natural gas, then passing the purified gases over an iron catalyst at 
        around 450°C and 200 atmospheres.<br>
        - Some nitrogen and hydrogen react to form ammonia, but the equilibrium is reversible, so some product 
        reverts to the reactants.<br>
        - <code>nitrogen + hydrogen ⇌ ammonia</code>
        - Cooling liquefies the ammonia for removal while unreacted gases are recycled.<br>
        - Understanding the dynamic equilibrium explains the need to balance rate and position: higher
        temperature increases rate but shifts equilibrium unfavorably, while higher pressure favors ammonia 
        formation but increases costs.<br>
        - Commercial conditions reflect the availability and cost of raw materials, energy, and the need 
        to maximise yield efficiently.<br>
        - For example, if the cost of energy is high, the process may operate at a slightly lower 
        temperature to save on energy costs, even if it means a lower yield of ammonia.

    <h2>10.4.2 Production and uses of NPK fertilisers</h2>
    <p>
        - Compounds of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium are used as fertilisers to improve agricultural productivity.<br>
        - NPK fertilisers contain compounds of all three elements.<br>
        - Industrial production of NPK fertilisers can be achieved using a variety of raw materials in several integrated processes:
        <ul>
            <li>Reaction of ammonia with nitric acid to form ammonium nitrate before blending.</li>
            <li>Potassium chloride, potassium sulfate and phosphate rock are obtained by mining, but phosphate 
                rock cannot be used directly as a fertiliser.</li>
            <li>Phosphate rock is treated with nitric acid or sulfuric acid to produce soluble salts that can be used as fertilisers.</li>
            <li>This produces the salts calcium nitrate and phosphoric acid when treated with nitric acid, and 
                when treated with sulfuric acid, it produces single superphosphate, which is a mixture of calcium sulfate and calcium phosphate.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Laboratory vs Industrial methods</h3>
    <p>
        - In the laboratory, NPK fertilisers can be prepared by mixing appropriate amounts of ammonium nitrate, potassium chloride and phosphate rock, 
        but this is not practical for large-scale production due to the need for precise measurements and the handling of large quantities of materials.<br> 
        - Industrially, the production of NPK fertilisers involves more complex processes that allow for the efficient handling of raw materials and the p
        roduction of large quantities of fertiliser. This includes the use of chemical reactors, separation techniques and blending processes to 
        ensure the final product meets quality standards.

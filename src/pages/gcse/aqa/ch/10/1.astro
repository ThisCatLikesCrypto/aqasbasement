    <h1>10.1 Using the Earth's resources and obtaining potable water</h1>
    <h2>10.1.1 Using the Earth's resources and sustainable development</h2>
    <p>
        - Humans can use the Earth's resources to provide warmthm, shelter, food and transport.<br>
        - These natural resources are supplemented by agriculture to provide food, timber, clothing, and fuels.<br>
        - Finite resources are resources where there is only a limited supply. Finite resources from the Earth, oceans, 
        and atmosphere, are processed to provide energy and materials.<br>
        - Finite resources include fossil fuels (oil, coal, and natural gas) and metal ores.<br>
        - Renewable resources are resources that can be replaced at the same rate as, or faster than, they are used.<br>
        - Examples of renewable resources include timber (if managed correctly), water, and wind energy.<br>
        - Sustainable resource management is using resources while leaving enough for future generations to meet their needs.<br>
        - Carbon-neutral resources come from plants. The carbon dioxide absorbed by the plants as they grow is equal to the carbon dioxide released when they are burned.<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>10.1.2 Potable water</h2>
    <p>
        - Potable water is water that is safe to drink.<br>
        - Fresh water is water that has a low concentration of dissolved salts and microbes.<br>
        - Most fresh water is found in lakes, rivers, and groundwater.<br>
        - In the UK, fresh water from rivers and lakes is treated to make it potable by:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>choosing an appropriate source of fresh water</li>
            <li>passing the water through filter beds (sand, gravel, and charcoal)</li>
            <li>sterilisation (using chlorine, ozone, or ultraviolet light) to kill microbes</li>
        </ul>
        - In areas where there is a limited supply of fresh water, salty water from the sea or from underground sources 
        can be treated to produce potable water. This process is called desalination.<br>
        - Desalination methods include distillation (heating the water until it evaporates, then condensing the vapour) and 
        reverse osmosis (forcing the water through a membrane that only allows water molecules to pass through).<br>
        - Both methods of desalination require large amounts of energy, making them expensive.<br><br>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Sampling</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>Collect labelled samples from each source (tap, river, groundwater, seawater, wastewater). Record location, time, temperature.</li>
                    <li>Use clean glassware; avoid cross-contamination; store cold and test promptly.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Calibrate pH meter with pH 4.00 and 7.00 (and 10.00 if necessary). Rinse probe between samples.</li>
                    <li>Measure and record pH and temperature for each sample; optionally compare with universal indicator paper/solution.</li>
                    <li>Notes: pH affects solubility and disinfection effectiveness.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><b>Dissolved solids (TDS) / total dissolved solids</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>Method A: Conductivity/TDS meter: calibrate, measure conductivity and convert to TDS using device factor; quick non-destructive test.</li>
                    <li>Method B: Gravimetric (precise): filter sample to remove suspended solids, evaporate a known volume to dryness in a pre-weighed crucible (dry at ~105 °C), cool in desiccator, weigh residue. Calculate mg L⁻¹ = (mass residue / volume sample in L) × 1000.</li>

                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><b>Additional tests (optional)</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>Chloride: titration (AgNO3) or ion-selective electrode.</li>
                    <li>Turbidity: nephelometer or visual comparison.</li>
                    <li>Microbial presence: culture tests (if required) or use membrane filtration methods.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><b>Purification methods</b>
                <ul>

                    <li>Desalination/distillation: simple distillation apparatus — heat sample, collect condensate; distilled water should have very low conductivity and low residue on evaporation.</li>
                    <li>Reverse osmosis note: high energy, uses semipermeable membrane (lab demo usually limited to simple distillation).</li>
                </ul>

            <li><b>Distillation practical notes</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>Set up round-bottom flask, condenser, and receiver; use boiling chips; control heating to avoid bumping.</li>
                    <li>Collect fractions if required; measure pH, conductivity, and TDS of distillate and compare with feed.</li>
                    <li>Record mass/volume of distillate and residue; calculate % removal of dissolved solids.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

    <h2>10.1.4 Alternative methods of extracting metals</h2>
    <p>
        - The Earth’s resources of metal ores are limited.<br>
        - Traditional open-cast mining takes lots of energy, makes large holes in the ground, 
        and produces large amounts of waste material.<br>
        - It can also cause deforestation, habitat loss, and pollution of land and water with chemicals used 
        in the extraction process (e.g. sulphuric acid).<br>
        - The mining can use explosives made from crude oil and the transporting, sorting, and refining of the ore
        all use large amounts of energy from fossil fuels.<br>
        - Most copper is extracted by smelting copper rich ores.<br>
        - Electrolysis is used to purify impure copper obtained from smelting.<br>
        - Sulphuric acid can be used to produce copper sulphate solution from low-grade ores.<br>
        - Copper is then extracted from the solution by displacement using scrap iron.<br>
        - Phytomining and bioleaching are alternative methods of extracting metals from low-grade ores using plants and bacteria respectively.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Phytomining</h3>
    <p>
        - Phytomining uses plants to absorb metal compounds (often from the waste from previous mining).
        <ol>
            <li>Plants are used to absorb metal compounds.</li>
            <li>Plants are harvested, then burned to produce ash.</li>
            <li>An acid is added to the ash to produce a solution containing dissolved metal ions (leachate).</li>
            <li>Copper can be obtained from the solution by displacement using scrap iron.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>Bioleaching</h3>
    <p>
        - Bioleaching uses bacteria that feed on low-grade metal ores to produce leachate solutions that contain dissolved
        metal compounds.<br>
        - The metal compounds can then be processed by electrolysis or displacement to obtain the metal.

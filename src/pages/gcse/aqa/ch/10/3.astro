    <h2>10.3.1 Corrosion and its prevention</h2>
    <p>
        - Corrosion is the destruction of materials by chemical reactions with substances in the environment.<br>
        - Rusting is an example of corrosion.<br>
        - Both air and water are necessary for iron to rust:<br>
        <code>4Fe + 3O<sub>2</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>O → 4Fe(OH)<sub>3</sub></code>
    </p>
    <h3>Preventing corrosion</h3>
    <p>
        - Corrosion can be prevented by applying a coating that acts as a barrier, such as greasing, painting or
        electroplating.<br>
        - This stops the iron from coming into contact with air and water.<br>
        - Aluminium forms an oxide coating which acts as a protective layer, preventing further corrosion.<br>
        - Sacrificial protection can be used to prevent corrosion of iron. This involves attaching a more reactive
        metal,
        such as zinc or magnesium, to the iron. The more reactive metal will corrode instead of the iron, protecting it
        from rusting.<br>
        - This is used a lot in water systems - your hot water tank probably has a sacrificial zinc anode inside it to
        prevent corrosion of the tank.

    <h2>10.3.3 Ceramics, polymers and composites</h2>
    <p>
        - Most of the glass we use is soda-lime glass, made by heating a mixture of sand, sodium carbonate and limestone.<br>
        - There is also Borosilicate glass, made from sand and boron trioxide, which has a higher melting point and is used for laboratory glassware and cookware.<br>
        - Clay ceramics, including pottery and bricks, are made by shaping wet clay and then heating in a furnace.
    </p>
    <h3>Polymers</h3>
    <p>
        - The properties of polymers depend on what monomers they are made from and the conditions under which they are made.
        For example, low density (LD) and high density (HD) poly(ethene) are produced from ethene (duh).<br>
        - They are produced under different conditions: LD poly(ethene) is made at high pressure and temperature with a catalyst, 
        while HD poly(ethene) is made at lower pressure and temperature without a catalyst.<br>
        - There are two types of polymers: thermosetting and thermosoftening.<br> 
        - Thermosoftening polymers consist of individual polymer chains that are tangled together. They can be melted and remoulded 
        because there are no covalent bonds between the chains, only weak intermolecular forces. They are used in packaging and containers.<br> 
        - Thermosetting polymers have strong covalent bonds between the polymer chains, forming a rigid structure. 
        They cannot be remoulded once set. They are used in electrical fittings and adhesives.
    </p> 
    <h3>Composites</h3> 
    <p>
        - Composites are materials made from two or more different materials, where the properties of the composite are better than those of the individual components.<br> 
        - The two materials are a matrix or binder surrounding and binding together fibres or fragments of the other material, which is called the reinforcement.<br>
        - Examples include fibreglass (glass fibres in a polymer matrix) and carbon fibre (carbon fibres in a polymer matrix).

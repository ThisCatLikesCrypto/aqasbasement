    <h1>10.2 Life cycle assessment and recycling</h1>
    <h2>10.2.1 Life cycle assessment</h2>
    <p>
        - Life cycle assessments are carried out to assess the environmental impact of a product over its entire life cycle.<br>
        - The stages of a product's life cycle include:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Raw material extraction</li>
            <li>Manufacturing</li>
            <li>Use/reuse/maintenance</li>
            <li>Recycle/waste management</li>
        </ul>
        - Use of water, resources, energy sources and production of some wastes can be fairly easily quantified by simply measuring.<br>
        - Allocating numerical values to pollutant effects is less straightforward and requires value judgements, so LCA is not a purely objective process.<br>
        - Selective or abbreviated LCAs can be devised to evaluate a product but these can be misused to reach pre-determined conclusions, e.g. in support of claims for advertising purposes.

                <td>Not very recyclable - often ends up in landfill (producing methane emissions) or in incineration plants. Recycling is 
                    technically possible through cracking and breaking down into monomers, and this is infinitely possible, but this does not happen very often.

        I think that paper bags are better for the environment due to being made from renewable resources and being biodegradable, despite the higher energy costs 
        (which, if from renewable sources, are less harmful).<br>

    <p>
        I think paper cups are better for the environment overall despite the higher energy costs in manufacture because they are made from renewable resources, are biodegradable,
        and are carbon-neutral. The plastic cups are made from finite resources and are not biodegradable, although they do use less energy in manufacture and transportation.

    <h2>10.2.2 Ways of reducing the use of resources</h2>
    <p>
        - The reduction in use, resuse, and recycling, of materials by end users reduces the use of 
        <b>limited resources</b>, use of <b>energy sources</b>, <b>waste</b>, and <b>environmental impact</b>.<br>
        - Metals, glass, building materials, clay ceramics and most plastics are produced from limited raw materials.<br>
        - Much of the energy used in manufacturing also comes from limited resources - fossil fuels.<br>
        - Obtaining the raw materials has an environmental impact - habitat destruction, pollution from mining and quarrying, 
        and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from machinery.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Glass</h3>
    <p>
        - Some products, such as glass bottles, can be reused without any further processing.<br>
        - Glass can be recycled by melting and remoulding it to make new glass products.<br>
        - Recycling glass saves energy and raw materials.<br>
        - Glass (and metals) can be recycled an infinite number of times.<br>
        - Other products cannot be reused directly but can be recycled, e.g. aluminium cans.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Metals</h3>
    <p>
        - Metals are often recycled by melting and recasting them to make new products.<br>
        - They have to be separated - the amount of separation required depends on the use of the recycled metal.<br>
        - Magnets can be used to separate ferrous metals (which contain iron) from non-ferrous metals.<br>
        - Metals can be separated by density using a centrifuge.<br>
        - Some scrap steel can be added to iron from a blast furnace to reduce the amount of iron that 
        needs to be extracted from iron ore.

    <h3>Paper</h3>
    <p>
        - Paper can be recycled by pulping it and then re-forming sheets of paper from the pulp.<br>
        - Recycling paper saves trees, energy, water, and landfill space.<br>
        - Paper can only be recycled a limited number of times because the fibres get shorter and weaker as they are cut.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Plastics</h3>
    <p>
        - Some plastics can be recycled by melting and remoulding them to make new products.<br>
        - Different types of plastic have to be separated before recycling.<br>
        - Some plastics can be recycled chemically by breaking them down into their monomers which can then be used to make new polymers.<br>
        - Not all plastics can be recycled - some are thermosetting plastics which cannot be melted and remoulded.

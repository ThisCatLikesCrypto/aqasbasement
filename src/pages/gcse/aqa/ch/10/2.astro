    <h1>10.2 Life cycle assessment and recycling</h1>
    <h2>10.2.1 Life cycle assessment</h2>
    <p>
        - Life cycle assessments are carried out to assess the environmental impact of a product over its entire life cycle.<br>
        - The stages of a product's life cycle include:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Raw material extraction</li>
            <li>Manufacturing</li>
            <li>Use/reuse/maintenance</li>
            <li>Recycle/waste management</li>
        </ul>
        - Use of water, resources, energy sources and production of some wastes can be fairly easily quantified by simply measuring.<br>
        - Allocating numerical values to pollutant effects is less straightforward and requires value judgements, so LCA is not a purely objective process.<br>
        - Selective or abbreviated LCAs can be devised to evaluate a product but these can be misused to reach pre-determined conclusions, e.g. in support of claims for advertising purposes.

                <td>Easily recyclable, but a limited number of times. Can be composted (biodegradable) or incinerated (reclaims heat energy but releases toxic compounds).</td>
                <td>Not very recyclable - often ends up in landfill (producing methane emissions) or in incineration plants. Recycling is 
                    technically possible through cracking and breaking down into monomers, and this is infinitely possible, but this does not happen very often.
                    Non-biodegradable.</td>

    <p>
        I think that paper bags are better for the environment due to being made from renewable resources and being biodegradable, despite the higher energy costs 
        (which, if from renewable sources, are less harmful).<br>

    <p>
        I think paper cups are better for the environment overall despite the higher energy costs in manufacture because they are made from renewable resources, are biodegradable,
        and are carbon-neutral. The plastic cups are made from finite resources and are not biodegradable, although they do use less energy in manufacture and transportation.

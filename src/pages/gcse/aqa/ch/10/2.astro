    <h1>10.2 Life cycle assessment and recycling</h1>
    <h2>10.2.1 Life cycle assessment</h2>
    <p>
        - Life cycle assessments are carried out to assess the environmental impact of a product over its entire life cycle.<br>
        - The stages of a product's life cycle include:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Raw material extraction</li>
            <li>Manufacturing</li>
            <li>Use/reuse/maintenance</li>
            <li>Recycle/waste management</li>
        </ul>
        - Use of water, resources, energy sources and production of some wastes can be fairly easily quantified by simply measuring.<br>
        - Allocating numerical values to pollutant effects is less straightforward and requires value judgements, so LCA is not a purely objective process.<br>
        - Selective or abbreviated LCAs can be devised to evaluate a product but these can be misused to reach pre-determined conclusions, e.g. in support of claims for advertising purposes.

                <td>Not very recyclable - often ends up in landfill (producing methane emissions) or in incineration plants. Recycling is 
                    technically possible through cracking and breaking down into monomers, and this is infinitely possible, but this does not happen very often.

        I think that paper bags are better for the environment due to being made from renewable resources and being biodegradable, despite the higher energy costs 
        (which, if from renewable sources, are less harmful).<br>

    <p>
        I think paper cups are better for the environment overall despite the higher energy costs in manufacture because they are made from renewable resources, are biodegradable,
        and are carbon-neutral. The plastic cups are made from finite resources and are not biodegradable, although they do use less energy in manufacture and transportation.

    <h2>10.2.2 Ways of reducing the use of resources</h2>
    <p>
        - The reduction in use, resuse, and recycling, of materials by end users reduces the use of 
        <b>limited resources</b>, use of <b>energy sources</b>, <b>waste</b>, and <b>environmental impact</b>.<br>
        - Metals, glass, building materials, clay ceramics and most plastics are produced from limited raw materials.<br>
        - Much of the energy used in manufacturing also comes from limited resources - fossil fuels.<br>
        - Obtaining the raw materials has an environmental impact - habitat destruction, pollution from mining and quarrying, 
        and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from machinery.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Glass</h3>
    <p>
        - Some products, such as glass bottles, can be reused without any further processing.<br>
        - Glass can be recycled by melting and remoulding it to make new glass products.<br>
        - Recycling glass saves energy and raw materials.<br>
        - Glass (and metals) can be recycled an infinite number of times.<br>
        - Other products cannot be reused directly but can be recycled, e.g. aluminium cans.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Metals</h3>
    <p>
        - Metals are often recycled by melting and recasting them to make new products.<br>
        - They have to be separated - the amount of separation required depends on the use of the recycled metal.<br>
        - Magnets can be used to separate ferrous metals (which contain iron) from non-ferrous metals.<br>
        - Metals can be separated by density using a centrifuge.<br>
        - Some scrap steel can be added to iron from a blast furnace to reduce the amount of iron that 
        needs to be extracted from iron ore.

                <td>Advantages</td>
                <td>Less virgin bauxite mining, lower energy and carbon emissions, and lower transport impacts 
                    when fewer aluminium products are manufactured. Not mining also reduces habitat destruction, 
                    deforestation, pollution, etc etc. Reduces cost.</td>
                <td>Saves resources and energy. Higher quality, reusable products e.g. aluminium water bottles can be used many times.
                    Eliminates 100% of the carbon footprint associated with producing new aluminium products.</td>
                <td>Aluminium can be melted and remade indefinitely, saving up to 95% of the energy compared to making new 
                    aluminium and reducing landfill. Collection schemes can earn you money or help fund recycling programs.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Disadvantages</td>
                <td>Requires consumers and manufacturers to change behaviour or redesign products, which can be costly or unpopular.
                    If we used other materials, the other materials may not be as good or have their own impacts (e.g. plastic).</td>
                <td>Needs systems for cleaning, collection, and redistribution, and may still have 
                    limited reuse cycles before recycling is needed.</td>
                <td>Collection, sorting, and cleaning add cost; contamination can reduce quality, and the logistics of 
                    gathering scrap can be complex. This also relies on people actually sorting correctly, which often doesn't happen.</td>

    <h3>Paper</h3>
    <p>
        - Paper can be recycled by pulping it and then re-forming sheets of paper from the pulp.<br>
        - Recycling paper saves trees, energy, water, and landfill space.<br>
        - Paper can only be recycled a limited number of times because the fibres get shorter and weaker as they are cut.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Plastics</h3>
    <p>
        - Some plastics can be recycled by melting and remoulding them to make new products.<br>
        - Different types of plastic have to be separated before recycling.<br>
        - Some plastics can be recycled chemically by breaking them down into their monomers which can then be used to make new polymers.<br>
        - Not all plastics can be recycled - some are thermosetting plastics which cannot be melted and remoulded.

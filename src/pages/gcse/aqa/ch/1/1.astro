    <h1>1.1 - A simple model of the atom, symbols, relative atomic mass,
        electronic charge and isotopes</h1>
    <h2>1.1.1 Atoms, elements and compounds</h2>
    <p>
        - All substances are made up of atoms, which are the smallest part 
        of an element that can exist.<br>
        - Atoms are represented by a symbol, for example <code>H</code> for hydrogen.<br>
        - There are 118 known elements, and each element has a unique symbol and position 
        on the periodic table.<br>
        - Compounds are formed from elements by chemical reactions.<br>
        - Reactions always involve the formation of one or more new substances and 
        often involve a detectable energy change.<br>
        - Compounds contain two or more elements chemically combined in
        fixed proportions and can be represented by formulae using the
        symbols of the atoms from which they were formed.<br>
        - Compounds can only be separated into elements by chemical reactions.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Equations</h2>
    <p>
        - Here is an example of a chemical reaction:<br>
        <code>2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub>{" -> 2H"}<sub>2</sub>O</code><br>
        - In that reaction, 4 hydrogen atoms (2x2; as hydrogen does not exist naturally 
        as a single atom), and 2 oxygen atoms (oxygen also doesn't exist as a single atom) 
        are combined to form 2 water molecules.<br>
        - That equation is <i>balanced</i>, meaning that the number of atoms of each 
        element is the same on both sides of the equation.<br>
        - The unbalanced equation would be:<br>
        <code>H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub>{" -> H"}<sub>2</sub>O</code><br>
        - Here, there is one oxygen atom left over, which you can't have.<br><br>
        - Equations can also be ionic (show electrical charge), for example:<br>
        <code>H<sup>+</sup> + OH<sup>-</sup>{" ->"} H<sub>2</sub>O</code><br>
        - Here, the hydrogen ion gains an electron, and the hydroxide ion loses one, in a neutralisation 
        reaction to form water (more on this later).<br><br>
        - Chemical reactions can be represented by word equations or equations using 
        symbols and formulae. For example, the reaction to form water above would be 
        written as <code>{"Hydrogen + Oxygen -> Water"}</code>.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>1.1.2 Mixtures</h2>
    <p>
        - A mixture consists of two or more elements or compounds <b>not</b> chemically combined together.<br>
        - The chemical properties of each substance in the mixture are unchanged.<br>
        - Mixtures can be separated by physical processes such as filtration,
        crystallisation, simple distillation, fractional distillation and
        chromatography. These physical processes do not involve chemical
        reactions and no new substances are made.

                <td>
                    Filtration involves pouring a mixture through filter paper placed in a funnel. The paper has tiny
                    pores that allow only liquids and very fine particles to pass through. The solid particles, which
                    are too large to pass through the pores, are trapped on the paper (called the residue). The liquid
                    that passes through is collected in a container below and is called the filtrate. This process does
                    not change the substances; it only separates them based on particle size.

                <td>
                    Crystallisation works by forming solid crystals from a solution. The solution is first gently heated
                    to partially evaporate the solvent (usually water), increasing the concentration of the solute. Once
                    it becomes saturated—meaning no more solute can dissolve—the mixture is left to cool slowly. As the
                    temperature drops, the solute particles come out of solution and form an orderly crystal structure.
                    Impurities remain in the solution and are left behind when the crystals are filtered and dried.

                <td>
                    Simple distillation uses the difference in boiling points between a solvent and solute. The solution
                    is heated until the solvent (which has a lower boiling point) boils and turns into vapor. This vapor
                    is then directed into a condenser, where it cools and turns back into liquid. The remaining solute,
                    which doesn’t evaporate, stays in the original container. This method is best when separating a
                    single solvent from a non-volatile solute, like salt in saltwater.

                <td>
                    Fractional distillation is an extension of simple distillation and is used for mixtures of liquids
                    with similar boiling points. The mixture is heated and vapors rise up a fractionating column, which
                    is packed with glass beads or plates to provide a surface for repeated condensation and
                    vaporisation. Substances with lower boiling points rise higher in the column and are collected
                    first, while those with higher boiling points condense lower down. This allows each component to be
                    separated more precisely.

                <td>
                    Use when separating mixtures like ethanol and water, or in industry for refining crude oil into

                <td>Separates components of a mixture based on how they travel through a medium.</td>
                <td>
                    Chromatography relies on differences in solubility and how substances interact with a stationary
                    phase (like paper) and a mobile phase (like a solvent). A small spot of the mixture is placed near
                    the bottom of chromatography paper. When the paper is placed in a solvent, the solvent travels up
                    the paper, carrying the components of the mixture with it. Substances that are more soluble in the
                    solvent move further up the paper, while those that are less soluble move more slowly. This
                    separates the components visibly.

    <h2>1.1.3 The development of the model of the atom</h2>
    <p>
        - In science, new experimental evidence may lead to a scientific model being
        changed or replaced.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Solid Sphere & Plum Pudding</h3>
    <p>
        - Before the discovery of the electron, atoms were thought to be tiny
        spheres that could not be divided. Simply the <b>solid sphere</b> model, proposed by John Dalton in 1803.<br>
        - The discovery of the electron led to the <b>plum pudding</b> model of the
        atom. The plum pudding model suggested that the atom is a ball of
        positive charge with negative electrons embedded in it. This was proposed by J.J. Thomson in 1897.

    </p>
    <h3>The alpha particle scattering experiment & nuclear model</h3>
    <p>
        - The experiment, carried out by Ernest Rutherford and his colleagues Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden in 1909, involved 
        firing alpha particles (positively charged particles) at a thin gold foil. Behind the foil, a detector screen coated 
        with zinc sulfide would light up whenever an alpha particle hit it, allowing the scientists to track the scattering patterns of the particles.<br>
        - Most alpha particles passed straight through the gold foil with very little deflection, indicating that atoms are mostly empty space.<br>
        - Some alpha particles were deflected at small angles, and a few were scattered back at very large angles, even bouncing straight back toward the source.

        - These observations led Rutherford to propose that atoms have a tiny, dense, positively charged nucleus at their centre as most of the atom was 
        shown to be empty space.<br>
        - The nucleus contains most of the atom's mass and repels the positively charged alpha particles when they come close to it.<br>
        - This nuclear model replaced the plum pudding model.
        <img class="centreimage" src="/images/ch/nuclear.webp" alt="nuclear model">
    </p>
    <h3>The Planetary (Bohr) model</h3>
    <p>
        Niels Bohr adapted the nuclear model by suggesting that electrons
        orbit the nucleus at specific distances. The theoretical calculations
        of Bohr agreed with experimental observations.
        <img class="centreimage" src="/images/ch/planetary.png" alt="bohr model">
    </p>
    <h3>Developments in the nucleus</h3>
    <p>
        - Later experiments led to the idea that the positive charge of any
        nucleus could be subdivided into a whole number of smaller
        particles, each particle having the same amount of positive charge.<br>
        - The name proton was given to these particles.<br>
        The experimental work of James Chadwick provided the evidence
        to show the existence of neutrons within the nucleus. This was
        about 20 years after the nucleus became an accepted scientific
        idea.

        - In an atom, the number of electrons is equal to the number of protons in the nucleus.<br>
        - Atoms have no overall electrical charge.<br>
        - The number of protons in an atom of an element is its atomic number.<br> 
        - All atoms of a particular element have the same number of protons.<br>
        - Atoms of different elements have different numbers of protons.

    <h2>1.1.5 Size and mass of atoms</h2>

        - Atoms are very small, having a radius of about 0.1 nm (1 x 10<sup>-10</sup> m).<br>
        - The radius of a nucleus is less than 1/10 000 of that of the atom (about 1 x 10<sup>-14</sup> m).<br>
        - Almost all of the mass of an atom is in the nucleus.<br>
        - The sum of the protons and neutrons in an atom is its mass number.<br>

    <h3>Notation</h3>
    <img class="centreimage" src="/images/ch/atom_notation.png" alt="Atom Notation">
    <h3>Isotopes</h3>
    <p>
        - Atoms of the same element can have different numbers of neutrons; these atoms are called isotopes of that element.<br>
        - For example, carbon-12 (C-12; <sup>12</sup>C), carbon-13 (C-13; <sup>13</sup>C) and carbon-14 (C-14; <sup>14</sup>C) are isotopes of carbon.<br>
        - Isotopes display the same chemical characteristics, due to them having same number of electrons in their outer shells 
        (which is what _actually_ matters for chemistry).<br>
        - They just add mass (and can make elements unstable/radioactive).
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>1.1.6 Relative atomic mass</h2>
    <p>
        - You need to be able to calculate relative atomic mass (A<sub>r</sub>).<br>
        - This is a measure equal to 1/12th the mass of a carbon-12 atom. Because this means that all relative atomic mass numbers are 
        ratios, there are no units.<br>
        - A hydrogen atom with one proton and one electron has a relative atomic mass of 1, so twelve hydrogen atoms have the same mass 
        as a carbon-12 atom.
    </p>
    <h3>Calculating A<sub>r</sub></h3>
    <p>
        - To calculate the relative atomic mass of an atom, you need to average out the mass of the main isotopes of the
        element.<br>
        - For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Chlorine has two main isotopes: chlorine-35 and chlorine-37.</li>
        <li>Chlorine-35 has an abundance of 75%, and chlorine-37 has an abundance of 25%.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        To calculate the relative atomic mass (A<sub>r</sub>):
    </p>
    <p>
        A<sub>r</sub> = (35 × 75/100) + (37 × 25/100) = 26.25 + 9.25 = <strong>35.5</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        So, the relative atomic mass of chlorine is <strong>35.5</strong>.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>1.1.7 Electronic structure</h2>
    <p>
        - Electrons orbit the nucleus in energy levels (or electron shells, different things but at GCSE they're basically the same so dw about it).<br>
        - The electrons in an atom occupy the lowest available energy levels (innermost available shells).<br>
        - The further away an energy level is from the nucleus, the higher the energy of the electrons in that shell.<br>
        - For GCSE you only need to care about the first 20 elements, which means you will never be dealing with more than 20 electrons in notation.<br>
        - The innermost level holds two electrons, the next two hold eight each, and the fourth one you don't need to care about because you'll only 
        ever see it filled with at most two electrons at GCSE (for Calcium).
    </p>
    <h3>Representing electronic structure</h3>
    <p>
        - Electronic structure can be represented by either numbers (called electronic configurations) or a diagram (electron shell diagrams).<br>
        - An electronic configurations is a string of numbers, each number representing an energy level.<br>
        - For example, the electron configuration of sodium is 2, 8, 1 as it has 11 electrons.<br>
        - Here's how that looks on an electron shell diagram:

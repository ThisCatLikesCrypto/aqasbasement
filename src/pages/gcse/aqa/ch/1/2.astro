    <h1>1.2 The periodic table</h1>
    <h2>1.2.1 The periodic table</h2>
    <p>
        - The elements in the periodic table are arranged in order of atomic (proton) number and so
        that elements with similar properties are in columns, known as groups.<br>
        - The table is called a periodic table because similar properties occur at regular intervals.<br>
        - Elements in the same group in the periodic table have the same number of electrons in their outer
        shell (outer electrons) and this gives them similar chemical properties.<br>
        - A periodic table is available at <a target="_blank" href="https://ptable.com">ptable.com</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Position in the Periodic Table and Electron Arrangement</h3>
    <p>The periodic table is arranged based on the <b>atomic number</b> — the number of
        <b>protons</b> in the nucleus (and also the number of <b>electrons</b> in a neutral atom).
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Periods (Rows):</b> Elements in the same period have the <b>same number of electron
                shells</b>.
            <br>Example: Sodium (Na) and Magnesium (Mg) are in <b>Period 3</b>, so both have <b>3
                electron shells</b>.
        </li>
        <li><b>Groups (Columns):</b> Elements in the same group have the <b>same number of valence
                electrons</b>.
            <br>Example:
            <ul>
                <li>Group 1 (e.g. Li, Na, K): all have <b>1 valence electron</b>.</li>
                <li>Group 17 (e.g. F, Cl, Br): all have <b>7 valence electrons</b>.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Atomic Number and Electron Configuration</h3>
    <p>The <b>atomic number</b> tells us how many <b>electrons</b> the atom has. These electrons
        fill up energy levels (shells) in a specific order (e.g., 2, 8, 8...). This helps us predict the
        <b>chemical behaviour</b> of an element.</p>

    <h3>Predicting Reactions and Reactivity</h3>
    <p>The number of <b>valence electrons</b> (from the group number) helps predict how an element will react:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Group 1 – Alkali Metals:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>1 valence electron → easily lost to form <b>+1 ions</b>.</li>
                <li>Very <b>reactive</b>, especially with water.</li>
                <li>Reactivity <b>increases down the group</b>.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Group 7 – Halogens:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>7 valence electrons → easily gain 1 electron to form <b>–1 ions</b>.</li>
                <li>Very <b>reactive non-metals</b>.</li>
                <li>Reactivity <b>decreases down the group</b>.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Group 8 – Noble Gases:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Full outer shell → very <b>stable</b> and <b>unreactive</b>.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1.2.2 Development of the Periodic Table</h2>
    <p>
        <sub>mostly taken from spec</sub><br>
        - Before the discovery of protons, neutrons, and electrons, scientists tried to classify elements 
        based on their atomic weights.<br>
        - This led to periodic tables being incomplete and some elements were placed in inappropriate groups 
        if the strict order of atomic weights was followed.
    </p>
    <h3>Early Periodic Tables</h3>
    <h4>Dalton's Periodic Table (by atomic weight)</h4>

    <h4>Newlands' Law of Octaves</h4>
    <img class="centreimage" src="/images/ch/newlandstable.png" alt="Newlands' Law of Octaves">
    <p>
        This is similar to how the periodic table is arranged today, and is an early version of how outer 
        shell electrons contribute to groups in the periodic table.
    </p>
    <h3>Mendeleev's Period Table</h3>
    <p>
        - Mendeleev's period table overcame these problems by leaving gaps for elements that he thought had 
        not been discovered and ins oem places changed the order even when it did not conform to atomic weights.<br>
        - Elements with properties, able to be predicted by his table, were discovered and filled the gaps. Knowledge 
        of isotopes made it possible to explain why the order based on atomic weights was not always correct.
    </p>
    <h4>An early version of Mendeleev's Period Table</h4>
    <img class="centreimage" src="/images/ch/mendeleevtable.png" alt="An early Mendeleev's Period Table">
    <p>
        How this table works is (essentially):<br>
        Iodine has a lower atomic weight compared to tellurium, which means it should be
        positioned before tellurium in Mendeleev's periodic table. However, iodine shares similar 
        chemical properties with chlorine and bromine. To align iodine with these elements in his table, 
        Mendeleev exchanged the places of iodine and tellurium.

    <h2>1.2.3 Metals and non-metals</h2>
    <p>
        <sub>(stolen from spec)</sub><br>
        - Elements that react to form positive ions are metals (e.g. Aluminium forms Al<sup>3+</sup>, as it 
        loses three electrons to form an ion.).<br>
        - Elements that do not form positive ions are non-metals (e.g. Oxygen forms O<sup>2-</sup>, as it gains
        two electrons to form an ion.).<br>
        - The majority of elements are metals. Metals are found to the left
        and towards the bottom of the periodic table. Non-metals are found
        towards the right and top of the periodic table.<br>
        - Metalloids display both metallic and non-metallic properties.

    <h2>1.2.4 Group 0</h2>
    <p>
        - The elements in group 0 are called the noble gases.<br>
        - They are unreactive and do not easily form molecules
        because their atoms have stable arrangements of electrons (there are eight electrons 
        in their outer shell, which means it is "full", except helium which has only two electrons).<br>
        - The boiling points of the noble gases increase with increasing relative atomic mass (going down the group):

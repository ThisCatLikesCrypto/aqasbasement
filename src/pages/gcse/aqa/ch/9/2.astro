    <h1>9.2 Carbon dioxide and methane as greenhouse gases</h1>
    <h2>9.2.1 Greenhouse Gases</h2>
    <p>
        - Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere maintain temperatures high enough on Earth to support life.<br>
        - These include carbon dioxide, water vapour, and methane.<br>
        - Methane is sigificantly more potent than methane, but carbon dioxide lasts longer in the atmosphere (methane 
        will slowly react with oxygen).<br>
        - Shorter-wavelength radiation (e.g. UV) can pass through the atmosphere, and is absorbed by the Earth, warming the surface.<br>
        - The warm surface re-emits longer wavelength radiation (infrared).<br>
        - Longer-wavelength radiation (e.g. infrared) is absorbed and re-radiated in all directions by greenhouse gases, trapping the heat.

    <h2>9.2.2 Human activities which contribute to an increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere</h2>
    <p>
        - Some human activities increase the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, enhancing the greenhouse effect and contributing to global warming.<br>
        - The main human activities which contribute to an increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are:<br>
        &emsp;• Burning fossil fuels (e.g. coal, oil, natural gas) for energy releases carbon dioxide.<br>
        &emsp;• Deforestation reduces the number of trees that can absorb carbon dioxide for photosynthesis.<br>
        &emsp;• Agriculture, particularly livestock farming, produces methane through enteric fermentation in ruminant animals.<br>
        &emsp;• Landfill sites produce methane as organic waste decomposes anaerobically.<br>
        - Based on peer-reviewed evidence, many scientists believe that human activities will cause the temperature of the Earth’s
        atmosphere to increase at the surface and that this will result in global climate change. (idk why aqa words it like this,
        climate change is clear and present).<br>
        - However, it is difficult to model such complex systems as global climate change.<br>
        - This leads to simplified models, speculation and opinions presented in the media that may be based on only parts of the evidence and which may be biased.<br>
        - For example, Nigel Farage has said "I haven’t got a clue whether climate change is being driven by carbon-dioxide emissions."

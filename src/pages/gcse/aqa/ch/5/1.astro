    <h1>Chemistry 5.1 Endothermic and exothermic reactions</h1>
    <h2>5.1.1 Energy transfer during exothermic and endothermic reactions</h2>
    <p>
        - The energy in the universe at before and after a reaction is the same.
        This is known as the law of conservation of energy.<br>
        - This means that, because energy can only be transferred, reactions that
        expel heat to the surroundings must end up with products that have less energy
        than the reactants.<br>
        - This is known as an <b>exothermic</b> reaction.<br>
        - Exothermic reactions include combustion, neutralisation, and many oxidation
        reactions.<br>
        - Everyday uses of them are for self-heating cans and hand warmers.<br>
        - The opposite of an exothermic reaction is an <b>endothermic</b> reaction.<br>
        - Endothermic reactions are when the products have more energy than the reactants.<br>
        - This causes the temperature of the surroundings to decrease, rather than
        increase as it would in an exothermic reaction.<br>
        - Endothermic reactions include thermal decompositions and the reaction of
        citric acid and sodium hydrogencarbonate. Some sports injury packs are based
        on endothermic reactions.

    <h2>5.1.2 Reaction profiles</h2>
    <p>
        - Chemical reactions can occur only when reacting particles collide with
        each other and with sufficient energy.<br>
        - The minimum amount of energy that particles must have to react is called
        the activation energy.<br>
        - Reaction profiles can be used to show the relative energies of reactants
        and products, the activation energy and the overall energy change of a reaction.

    <p>
        - For the exothermic reaction, the energy of the products will be lower
        than the energy of the reactants, so the change in energy is negative.<br>
        - For the endothermic reaction, the energy of the products will be higher
        than the energy of the reactants, so the change in energy is positive.
    </p>

    <h2>5.1.3 The energy change of reactions</h2>
    <p>
        - Bond energy (or bond enthalpy) is the amount of energy required to
        break one mole of a particular bond in a gaseous state. Different bonds
        have different bond energies — for example:
        <ul>
            <li>H-H bond in H₂: about 436 kJ/mol</li>
            <li>O=O bond in O₂: about 498 kJ/mol</li>
        </ul>
        - The energy needed to break bonds and the energy released when bonds are
        formed can be calculated from bond energies.<br>
        - The difference between the sum of the energy needed to break bonds in the
        reactants and the sum of the energy released when bonds in the products are
        formed is the overall energy change of the reaction.<br>
        - In an exothermic reaction, the energy released from forming new bonds is
        greater than the energy needed to break existing bonds.<br>
        - In an endothermic reaction, the energy needed to break existing bonds is
        greater than the energy released from forming new bonds.
    </p>
    <h3>Bond Energy Calculations</h3>
    <p>
        The energy change for a reaction is given by this formula:<br>
        <code
            >ΔH = Total energy to break bonds - Total energy to form bonds</code
        ><br>
        <ol>
            <li>List the bonds in reactants and products.</li>
            <li>Look up the bond energies (usually given in the exam).</li>
            <li>Add up the bond energies for all bonds broken (reactants).</li>
            <li>Add up the bond energies for all bonds formed (products).</li>
            <li>Use the formula to find the overall energy change.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h4>Example: Combustion of methane (CH₄ + 2O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O)</h4>

    <p><b>Bond energies (in kJ/mol):</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>C-H: <code>412</code></li>
        <li>O=O: <code>498</code></li>
        <li>C=O: <code>805</code></li>
        <li>O-H: <code>463</code></li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Step 1: Breaking bonds (reactants)</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>4 × C-H = <code>4 × 412 = 1648 kJ</code></li>
        <li>2 × O=O = <code>2 × 498 = 996 kJ</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Total energy needed to break bonds:</b></p>
    <code>1648 + 996 = 2644 kJ</code>

    <h5>Step 2: Forming bonds (products)</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>2 × C=O = <code>2 × 805 = 1610 kJ</code></li>
        <li>4 × O-H = <code>4 × 463 = 1852 kJ</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Total energy released by forming bonds:</b></p>
    <code>1610 + 1852 = 3462 kJ</code>

    <h5>Step 3: Calculate energy change</h5>
    <p><code>ΔH = 2644 - 3462 = -818 kJ</code></p>

    <p><b>Result:</b></p>
    <p>
        The negative value shows an <b>exothermic reaction</b> (releases
        heat).

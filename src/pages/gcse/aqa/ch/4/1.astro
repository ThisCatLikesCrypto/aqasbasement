    <h1>4.1 Reactivity of metals</h1>
    <h2>4.1.1 Metal oxides</h2>
    <p>
        - Metals react with oxygen to produce metal oxides. The reactions
        are oxidation reactions because the metals gain oxygen.<br>
        - <b>Oxidation</b> is the gain of oxygen by a substance.<br>
        - <b>Reduction</b> is the loss of oxygen from a substance.
    </p>
    <h3>Iron Example</h3>
    <p>
        - When iron reacts with oxygen, it forms iron oxide (rust).<br>
        - The reaction is: <br>
        4Fe + 3O<sub>2</sub> → 2Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub><br>
        - In this reaction, iron is oxidised (gains oxygen).<br>
        - In the opposite reaction: <br>
        2Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> → 4Fe + 3O<sub>2</sub><br>
        iron oxide is reduced (loses oxygen).
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>4.1.2 The reactivity series</h2>
    <p>
        - When metals react with other substances the metal atoms form positive ions.<br>
        - This is because in order to obtain a full outer shell of electrons (8 electrons), 
        metal atoms need to lose electrons.<br>
        - The reactivity of a metal is related to its tendency to form positive ions.<br>
        The reactivity series is a list of metals (and some non-metals) arranged in order of their reactivity,
        from most reactive to least reactive. It helps predict how metals will react with water, acids, and other substances.<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Potassium (most reactive)</li>
            <li>Sodium</li>
            <li>Lithium</li>
            <li>Calcium</li>
            <li>Magnesium</li>
            <li>Carbon (non-metal, included for comparison)</li>
            <li>Zinc</li>
            <li>Iron</li>
            <li>Nickel</li>
            <li>Hydrogen (non-metal, included for comparison)</li>
            <li>Lead</li>
            <li>Copper</li>
            <li>Silver</li>
            <li>Gold</li>
        </ul><br>
        - Metals higher in the series are more reactive and can displace those below them from compounds.
    </p>
    <h3>Reactions of metals with water:</h3>
    <p>
        - Potassium, sodium, and lithium react vigorously with cold water, producing hydrogen gas and a metal hydroxide.<br>
        - Calcium reacts less vigorously with water, forming calcium hydroxide and hydrogen gas.<br>
        - Magnesium reacts very slowly with cold water, but more rapidly with hot water.<br>
        - Zinc, iron, and copper do not react with cold water.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Reactions of metals with dilute acids:</h3>
    <p>
        - Potassium, sodium, and lithium react explosively with dilute acids (these reactions are not usually done for safety reasons).<br>
        - Calcium reacts rapidly with dilute acids, producing hydrogen gas.<br>
        - Magnesium reacts quickly with dilute acids, producing hydrogen gas.<br>
        - Zinc reacts moderately with dilute acids.<br>
        - Iron reacts slowly with dilute acids.<br>
        - Copper does not react with dilute acids.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Deduction from experiments:</h3>
    <p>
        - By observing how quickly metals react with water or dilute acids (e.g., rate of hydrogen gas production), you can deduce their order of reactivity.<br>
        - If a metal displaces another from a solution (e.g., zinc displacing iron from iron(II) sulfate), it is more reactive.
    </p>
    <h2>4.1.3 Extraction of metals and reduction</h2>
    <p>
        - Unreactive metals such as gold are found in the Earth as the metal itself but most 
        metals are found as compounds that require chemical reactions to extract the metal.<br>
        - Metals less reactive than carbon can be extracted from their oxides
        by reduction with carbon.<br>
        - Metals more reactive than carbon are extracted by electrolysis, this is covered later.<br>
        - For example, iron(III) oxide can be reduced by carbon to extract iron:<br>
        2Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 3C → 4Fe + 3CO<sub>2</sub><br>
        - In this reaction, iron(III) oxide is reduced (loses oxygen) and carbon is oxidised (gains oxygen).<br>
        - To interpret extraction processes, identify which substances gain or lose oxygen:
        <ul>
            <li>The substance that gains oxygen is oxidised.</li>
            <li>The substance that loses oxygen is reduced.</li>
        </ul>
        - For example, in the above reaction:
        <ul>
            <li>Iron(III) oxide is reduced to iron (loss of oxygen).</li>
            <li>Carbon is oxidised to carbon dioxide (gain of oxygen).</li>
        </ul>
        - You may be asked to evaluate extraction methods based on reactivity, cost, or environmental impact when given information.<br>
        - For example, extracting metals using carbon is often cheaper than electrolysis, but it can produce carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas.<br>
        - The environmental damage of that carbon dioxide is often outweighed by the huge amount of energy required for electrolysis, though.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>4.1.4 Oxidation and reduction in terms of electrons</h2>
    <p>
        - Oxidation is the loss of electrons and reduction is the gain of electrons.<br>
        - In displacement reactions, a more reactive metal displaces a less reactive metal from its compound. These reactions can be represented by ionic equations.<br>
        <b>Example:</b> Zinc displaces copper from copper(II) sulfate:<br>
        Zn(s) + CuSO<sub>4</sub>(aq) → ZnSO<sub>4</sub>(aq) + Cu(s)<br>
        The ionic equation is:<br>
        Zn(s) + Cu<sup>2+</sup>(aq) → Zn<sup>2+</sup>(aq) + Cu(s)<br>
        <b>Half equations:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Zn(s) → Zn<sup>2+</sup>(aq) + 2e<sup>-</sup> (oxidation, zinc loses electrons)</li>
            <li>Cu<sup>2+</sup>(aq) + 2e<sup>-</sup> → Cu(s) (reduction, copper ions gain electrons)</li>
        </ul>
        - To identify which species are oxidised and which are reduced:
        <ul>
            <li>The species that loses electrons is oxidised.</li>
            <li>The species that gains electrons is reduced.</li>
        </ul>
        - In the above example, zinc is oxidised and copper ions are reduced.
    </p>
    <h3>Half Equations</h3>
    <p>
        - Half equations show either the oxidation or reduction part of a redox reaction.<br>
        - They include the electrons lost or gained in the process.<br>
        - For example, in the reaction where magnesium reacts with oxygen to form magnesium oxide:<br>
        2Mg + O<sub>2</sub> → 2MgO<br>
        The half equations are:<br>
        Oxidation: Mg → Mg<sup>2+</sup> + 2e<sup>-</sup><br>
        Reduction: O<sub>2</sub> + 4e<sup>-</sup> → 2O<sup>2-</sup><br>
        - In this case, magnesium is oxidised (loses electrons) and oxygen is reduced (gains electrons).

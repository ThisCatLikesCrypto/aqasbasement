    <h1>Macbeth</h1>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>War in Scotland.</li>
            <li>Macbeth does very well in battle.</li>
            <li>The original Thane of Cawdor is a traitor and is executed.</li>
            <li>Macbeth is promoted to Thane of Cawdor by the King.</li>
            <li>The witches meet Macbeth and tell him he is Thane of Cawdor, will become King, but Banquo’s children will be kings. This happens before Macbeth is informed of his new title.</li>
            <li>Macbeth is officially told he is Thane of Cawdor and immediately believes the witches, turning his thoughts to how he might become King.</li>
            <li>Malcolm is promoted to Prince of Cumberland, marking him as next in line. Macbeth thinks he must overcome him to become King.</li>
            <li>Lady Macbeth receives Macbeth’s letter and begins plotting Duncan’s murder. Macbeth is initially horrified.</li>
            <li>Lady Macbeth calls on dark spirits for the strength to kill Duncan.</li>
            <li>Macbeth quickly warms to the idea of killing Duncan; Lady Macbeth questions his courage to push him into doing it.</li>
            <li>Macbeth forgets to leave the daggers with Duncan’s guards to frame them.</li>
            <li>The murder is discovered and the guards are suspected. Duncan’s sons flee, leaving Macbeth to take the throne.</li>
            <li>Macbeth becomes King, and Banquo suspects Macbeth had a hand in the events.</li>
            <li>Macbeth hires assassins to kill Banquo and his son; the son escapes.</li>
            <li>Banquo’s ghost haunts Macbeth at a banquet. Macbeth breaks down and the feast ends early.</li>
            <li>Macbeth visits the witches again.</li>
            <li>After Macbeth recounts his deeds, the witches call him “wicked”.</li>
            <li>Prophecies: “Beware Macduff”, “None of woman-born shall harm Macbeth”, and Macbeth will be safe until Birnam Wood appears to move.</li>
            <li>Macbeth sends murderers to kill Macduff’s family.</li>
            <li>Macduff meets Malcolm in England to test their loyalty to Scotland and plan Macbeth’s overthrow.</li>
            <li>Lady Macbeth suffers hallucinations and takes her own life.</li>
            <li>Birnam Wood seems to move as the army advances with branches for camouflage, and battle begins.</li>
            <li>Macbeth fights Macduff and is killed.</li>

    <h2>Aspects of a Tragedy</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Mimesis</b> – the imitation of real human action, behaviour, or life in a work of drama.</li>
            <li><b>Magnitude</b> – the idea that a tragic story must have appropriate seriousness, scale, and importance.</li>
            <li><b>Hamartia</b> – a tragic flaw or error in judgement that leads the hero towards downfall.</li>
            <li><b>Hubris</b> – excessive pride or arrogance that causes the hero to challenge moral or divine law.</li>
            <li><b>Peripeteia</b> – the sudden reversal of fortune, when the hero’s situation turns dramatically for the worse.</li>
            <li><b>Anagnorisis</b> – the moment of recognition or realisation, often when the hero understands their mistake.</li>
            <li><b>Death (by suicide)</b> – a self-inflicted death, often used in tragedy to show despair or the consequences of the hero’s actions. This is often the result of 
                an anagnorisis: when the tragic hero realises what they have done, they only way they can repay their debt to society is suicide.</li>
            <li><b>Catharsis</b> – the emotional release felt by the audience as pity and fear are resolved at the end of the tragedy.</li>
            <li><b>Chorus</b> – a group of performers who comment on the action, provide background, and reflect public opinion.</li>
            <li><b>Catastrophe (natural chaos)</b> – the disastrous final event of the play, often involving destruction, disorder, or ruin.</li>
            <li><b>Three Unities (place, plot, time)</b> – classical rules stating that a play should have one setting, one main storyline, and take place within a single day.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Act 1</h2>
    <p>
        In Act 1 of Macbeth, we are introduced to the main characters and the setting of the play. The act opens with the three witches, who set a dark and ominous tone. 
        They plan to meet Macbeth after a battle. We then see King Duncan receiving news of Macbeth's bravery in battle, leading to his promotion to Thane of Cawdor. 
        Macbeth and Banquo encounter the witches, who prophesy that Macbeth will become king and Banquo's descendants will also be kings. This prophecy sparks Macbeth's 
        ambition and sets the stage for the unfolding drama.

    <h3>hide your goddamn fires</h3>
    <p>
        heres a load of ways you can use this because i swear this quote is amazing:
        <ul>
            <li>Macbeth is hiding from God</li>
            <li>Macbeth does not want others to find out about his intents and is worried about this</li>
            <li>Macbeth is extinguishing his own nobleness</li>
            <li>Macbeth is trying to psych himself up for regicide</li>
            <li>Macbeth is struggling with his conscience</li>
            <li>Macbeth is aware of the moral darkness he is about to embrace</li>
            <li>Macbeth knows he is about to do something evil and cannot justify it in any other way</li>
            <li>Macbeth is hiding from light - this is a recurring motif</li>
            <li>Macbeth is aligning himself with darkness, representing the devil and hell</li>
            <li>Macbeth wants to block out his own “inner light” – his reason and morality – so he can commit the crime without hesitation.</li>
            <li>He is trying to silence Heaven’s judgement, rejecting divine oversight so that “the eye” of God cannot witness his sin.</li>
            <li>The line reinforces the theme of appearance vs reality: outwardly loyal, inwardly plotting treason in total secrecy.</li>
            <li>It foreshadows Macbeth’s mental darkness later in the play – insomnia, visions, and paranoia after smothering his conscience.</li>
            <li>Macbeth is attempting to control the narrative of events; if no one “sees,” then no one can challenge his rise to power.</li>
            <li>The rejection of light symbolically cuts him off from spiritual salvation, suggesting that this choice damns his soul.</li>
            <li>It reflects Jacobean fears about regicide: to kill the king is to oppose God’s order (the great chain of being again), so Macbeth must hide 
                from cosmic/godly as well as human law.</li>
            <li>The imperative “hide” shows he knows the deed is wrong; the very need for darkness proves he understands the full moral weight of his plan.</li>
        </ul>

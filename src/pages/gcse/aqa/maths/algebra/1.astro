    <h1>Equations</h1>
    <h2>Regular Equations</h2>
    <p>
        Say you have an equation like 
        \(3x = 9\)
        <br>
        To solve this, you would divide both sides by 3 to get \(x = 3\).
    </p>

    <h2>Example 1</h2>
    <p>
        {"\\(\\displaystyle \\frac{x + 2}{5} = 2\\)"}
        <br>
        \(x+2 = 10\)
        <br>
        \(x = 8\)
    </p>

    <h2>Example 2</h2>
    <p>
        {"\\(\\displaystyle \\frac{3x - 6}{3} = 2\\)"}
        <br>
        \(3x-6=6\)
        <br>
        \(3x = 12\)
        <br>
        \(x = 4\)
    </p>
    <h2>Factorising and Solving Quadratics</h2>
    <p>
        Say you have an equation like
        \(x^2 + 4x + 4\)

        <br>
        To solve it, you have to find 2 numbers that add to 4 and also times to 4 (because it is 4x + 4)
        <br>
        The only possible answer is 2 and 2 (2*2 = 4, 2+2 = 4)
        <br>
        Next you need to seperate the 4x into those 2 numbers to get
        \(x^2 + 2x + 2x + 4\)
        and then factorise it
        <br>
        To factorise it you need to find the common factors of \(x^2 + 2x\) and \(2x + 4\)
        <br>
        Lets start with \(x^2 + 2x\). The common factor here is x so it becomes \(x(x + 2)\).
        <br>
        For \(2x + 4\), the common factor is 2 and so it becomes \(2(x + 2)\). In factorising, the insides of both brackets has to be the same.
        <br>
        Now using those common factors, you combine them together to get \((x+2)\) which you combine with the insides of the other brackets to get \((x+2)(x+2)\) or \((x+2)^2)
    </p>

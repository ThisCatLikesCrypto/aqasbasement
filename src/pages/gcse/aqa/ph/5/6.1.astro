    <h1>5.6.1 - Describing motion along a line</h1>
    <h2>5.6.1.4 The distance-time relationship</h2>
    <p>
        - If an object moves along a straight line, the distance travelled can
        be represented by a distance-time graph.<br />
        - The speed of an object can be calculated from the gradient of its distance-time
        graph.<br />
        - If an object is accelerating, its speed at any particular time can be determined
        by drawing a tangent and measuring the gradient of the distance-time graph
        at that time.
    </p>

    <h2>5.1.1 Scalar and vector quantities</h2>
    <p>
        - Every quantity is either <b>scalar</b>, or <b>vector</b>.<br />
        - Scalar quantities have magnitude but no direction.<br />
        - Vector quantities have magnitude and direction.<br />
        - A vector quantity may be represented by a vector arrow. The length of the
        arrow represents the magnitude, and the direction of the arrow shows the
        direction of the vector quantity.<br />

    <h2>5.1.2 Contact and non-contact forces</h2>
    <p>
        - A force is a push or pull that acts on an object due to the
        interaction with another object.<br />
        - All forces between objects are either:
        <ul>
            <li>contact forces - the objects are physically touching</li>
            <li>non-contact forces - the objects are physically separated.</li>

                    against it)

                    Magnetic force (A force experienced between magnetic poles that
                    can be attractive or repulsive, e.g. the force between the north
                    and south poles of a magnet)

    <h2>5.1.3 Gravity</h2>
    <p>
        - Weight is the force acting on an object due to gravity. The force of
        gravity close to the Earth is due to the gravitational field around the
        Earth.<br />
        - The weight of an object depends on the gravitational field strength at
        the point where the object is.<br />
        - The weight of an object may be considered to act at a single point referred
        to as the object's "centre of mass".<br />
        - From the spec:

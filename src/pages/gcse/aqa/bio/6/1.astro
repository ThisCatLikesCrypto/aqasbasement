    <h3><span class="ace">Asexual</span> reproduction</h3>
    <p>
        - Involves one individual (parent), no fusion of gametes.<br>
        - No mixing of genetic information, offspring are genetically identical to parent (clones).<br>
        - Only mitosis is involved.<br>
        - Examples: Bacteria (binary fission), some plants (potato tubers grow shoots and roots; strawberry plants produce runners;
        spider plants grow plantlets on the ends of long stems), some animals (hydra by budding).
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Sexual reproduction</h3>
    <p>
        - Two parents.<br>
        - Fusion of male and female gametes to form a zygote.<br>
        - Mixing of genetic information, offspring are genetically different to parents.<br>
        - Involves meiosis (to produce gametes) and fertilisation (fusion of gametes).<br>
        - Leads to genetic variation in offspring.<br>
        - Gametes formed by meiosis, zygote divides by mitosis.<br>
        - Examples: Most animals and plants.

        - Cells in reproductive organs (testes and ovaries) divide by meiosis to produce gametes (sperm and egg).<br>
        - Each times the cell divides, cytokinesis has to happen.

            <li>Interphase: The DNA of each chromosome is replicated.<br>

            <li>One chromosome from each pair is pulled to opposite ends of the cell via spindle fibres. The cells divide again to form four gametes, each with a single set of chromosomes (haploid).
                These are genetically unique. Each cell has 23 chromosomes.<br>

    <h3>How sexual reproduction leads to variation</h3>
    <p>
        - Chromosomes line up at the equator.<br>
        - The way they line up is random (independent segregation).<br>
        - During meiosis chromosomes swap alleles (crossing over).<br>
        - Fertilisation is random (any sperm can fertilise any egg).<br>
        - This produces genetic variation in offspring.

    <h3>Malaria Life Cycle</h3>
    <p>
        - Malaria is caused by a parasite that is spread by mosquitoes.<br>
        - The infected mosquito bites an infected human.<br>
        - A blood temperature drop int he mosquito triggers sexual reproduction of the parasite.<br>
        - The male and female form of the parasite meet in the mosquito's gut to form a diploid cell (which has variation).<br>
        - The diploid zygote divides by mitosis to make loads of copies.<br>
        - Diploid cells travel to the saliva of the mosquito.<br>
        - <b>In the Human:</b><br>
        - The mosquito bites another human host, and diploid parasites travel to the liver to mature/reproduce asexually.<br>
        - Malaria <u>released</u> from liver cells to invade red blood cells.<br>
        - More asexual reproductions happens in RBCs causing them to burst.<br>
        - This causes symptoms of <u>fevers & fatigue</u>.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Types of reproduction in fungi</h3>
    <p>
        - Fungi usually reproduce asexually.<br>
        - Many fungi are made up of a mass of thin threads called hyphae (these form visible structures called mycelium).<br>
        - The hyphae produce spores by mitosis (asexual reproduction). These spores can then grow into new fungi.<br>
        - Some fungi can also reproduce sexually. During poor conditions (e.g. when it's dry), cells in the hyphae of
        two fungi undergo meiosis to form haploid cells.<br>
        - Two hyphae from different fungi join (haploid).<br>
        - Nuclei from hyphae fuse forming a diploid cell.<br>
        - This allows genetic variation.

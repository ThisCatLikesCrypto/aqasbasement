    </p>
    <p>
        - There are multiple receptors in the human nervous system that detect changes in the environment.
        <ul>
            <li><b>Eyes</b> detect light</li>
            <li><b>Skin</b> detects touch, pressure, pain, and changes in temperature</li>
            <li><b>Ears</b> detect sound and changes in body position for balance</li>
            <li><b>Nose and tongue</b> are sensitive to chemicals for smell and taste</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>How the nervous system works</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>A noticeable change in the environment happens (<b>stimulus</b>)</li>
            <li>The stimulus is detected by <b>receptors</b></li>
            <li>The <b>coordinator</b> (central nervous system [brain and spinal cord]) receives the impulse, 
                starting in a <b>sensory neurone</b>, travelling through <b>relay neurons</b> (which are also in the 
                brain) and makes a decision</li>
            <li>The CNS coordinates <b>Effectors</b>: Skeletal muscles contract or 
                glands secrete hormones to cause a response, and this impulse is recieved from a <b>motor neurone</b>.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>Types of neurons</h3>

    <p>
        - The terminals on a motor neurone would usually connect to a muscle or gland.
    </p>
    <h3>Exam Question</h3>
    <p>
        Explain what happens in your nervous system when you see a piece of fruit and pick it up. [6 marks]<br>
        - The piece of fruit is a stimulus.<br>
        - Sensory receptors in the eyes detect the reflection of light off of the piece of fruit.<br>
        - An electrical impulse travels along the sensory neurone through 
        relay neurons to the CNS.<br>
        - The CNS processes the impulse and decides to move muscles to 
        picks up the fruit.<br>
        - To do this, the CNS sends signals through relay neurons, which eventually 
        reach the muscles' motor neurones, which send signals to the muscles.<br>
        - The muscles contract to pick up the fruit.<br>
        - The effector is the skeletal muscle.
    </p>
    <h2>5.2.1 (Part 2) Reflexes</h2>
    <p>
        - Reflex actions are automatic and rapid &ndash; they do not involve the conscious part of the brain
        (are involuntary).<br><br>
        - <b>Synapses</b> are a gap in between neurons. Chemicals diffuse across the synapses. This allows 
        neurons to communicate between each other.<br>

        <sub><a href="https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-ap1/chapter/communication-between-neurons/">source</a></sub>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Electrical impulse travels to the synapse.</li>
            <li>Triggers chemicals to be released into the synapse.</li>
            <li>Chemicals diffuse across the synapse to the next neurone.</li>
            <li>Causes the electrical impulse to travel through the next neurone.</li>
        </ol>

    <h2>5.2.2 The brain</h2>
    <p>
        FSL: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fuv76dJKBkE">GCSE Biology Revision "The brain" (triple)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        - The brain controls complex behaviour. It is made of billions of interconnected neurones and has 
        different regions that carry out different functions.
    </p>
    <img class="centreimage" src="/images/bio/braindiagram.png" alt="Brain diagram">
    <sub><a href="https://humanbiology.pressbooks.tru.ca/chapter/10-5-central-nervous-system/">source</a></sub>
    <p>
        - The <b>cerebral cortex</b> is the outer layer of the brain, highly folded to increase surface area. 
        It is responsible for higher brain functions, such as:
        <ul>
            <li>Sensory perception (e.g., vision, hearing, touch)</li>
            <li>Voluntary motor control (movement initiation)</li>
            <li>Language</li>
            <li>Thinking and problem-solving</li>
            <li>Memory and learning</li>
            <li>Consciousness and decision-making</li>
        </ul><br>
        - The <b>cerebellum</b> coordinates voluntary movement and balance; it doesn't initiate movement but ensures it’s smooth and precise.
        Its roles are:
        <ul>
            <li>Fine-tuning motor activity</li>
            <li>Maintaining posture (bet this made you sit up straight)</li>
            <li>Ensuring balance and coordination</li>
            <li>Helping with motor learning (e.g., learning to ride a bike)</li>
        </ul><br>
        - The <b>medulla</b> (or medulla oblongata) controls vital involuntary functions and connects to the brain to the 
        spinal cord. Its functions are:
        <ul>
            <li>Regulating heart rate and blood pressure</li>
            <li>Controlling breathing</li>
            <li>Managing reflexes such as swallowing, coughing, sneezing, and vomiting</li>
        </ul><br>
        - The Hyprothamalmus is found at the base of the brain and is responsible for regulating body temperature.<br>
        - The Pituitary Gland is found below the hyprothamamus and is responsible for producing hormones for growth,
        blood pressure, and reproduction.
    </p>
    <h3>Difficulties in investigating brain function</h3>
    <p>
        - The brain is extremely complex with billions of interconnected neurons.<br>
        - Individual differences make diagnosis and treatment difficult.<br>
        - The brain is hard to access physically and protected by the skull and blood-brain barrier.<br>
        - Ethical limits restrict human brain research.<br>
        - Brain diseases are often progressive and currently incurable.<br>
        - Recovery from damage is unpredictable and varies between individuals.<br>
        - This means that many brain functions are still not fully understood.
    </p>
    <h3>Mapping regions of the brain</h3>
    <p>
        - Neuroscientists have learned a lot about how the brain works by using different methods.<br>
        - One way they do this is by examining patients with brain damage. By observing which abilities are lost or changed after 
        a certain part of the brain is injured, they can link that area to specific functions, like speech, movement, or memory.<br><br>
        - Another method is electrical stimulation. Scientists apply small electrical currents to parts of the brain during 
        surgery to see how the body reacts. This helps them understand what each part of the brain controls.<br><br>
        - They also use advanced scanning techniques like MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging). MRI scans produce detailed images 
        of the brain and allow scientists to see which parts are active during different tasks, such as thinking, speaking, or seeing.<br><br>
        - However, the brain is very delicate and complicated, which makes investigating it extremely difficult. 
        Even a small mistake in surgery or treatment can cause serious problems. Because of this, treating brain disorders is challenging, 
        and scientists must be very careful when studying or operating on the brain.

    <p>
        - Light that enters the cornea has to be focused using refraction.<br>
        - If the light is focused in front or behind the retina, the image will be blurred.<br>
        - The retina is composed of cones that allow us to see in colour, and rods that allows us 
        to monitor depth perception.<br>
        - The shape of the lens can be changed by the contraction and relaxation of ciliary muscles. This changes the amount 
        the lens refracts the light and this is important for seeing close and distant objects in focus.<br>
        - The amount of light entering the eye is controlled by a ring of muscle called the iris by controlling
        the size of the pupil.<br>
        - Circular muscles contract to make the pupil smaller, whereas radial muscles contract to make the pupil larger.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Accommodation</h3>
    <p>
        - The process of changing the shape of the lens to focus on near or distant objects.<br>
        To focus on a near object:
        <ol><b>
            <li>the ciliary muscles contract</li>
            <li>the suspensory ligaments loosen</li>
            <li>the lens is then thicker and refracts light rays strongly</li>

        To focus on a distant object:
        <ol><b>
            <li>the ciliary muscles relax</li>
            <li>the suspensory ligaments are pulled tight</li>

    <h2>Brandenburg Concerto No. 5 in D major, movement III</h2>
    <h3>Context</h3>
    <p>
        - Bach was a major composer of the Baroque period (and ever).<br>
        - Innovator in forms and structures still used and developed today.<br>
        - Brandenburg Concerto No.5 is part of a set of six concertos, dedicated to the Margrave of Brandenburg. It is
        an example of the concerto grosso form.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Sonority</h3>
    <p>
        - Harpsichord, violin, flute, cello, double bass, orchestra.<br>
        - Solo (concertino) - violino principale, flauto, cembalo concertato.<br>
        - Ripieno - Violono di ripieno, viola da ripieno, violoncello, contrabasso.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Structure</h3>
    <p>
        - ABA (ternary form).<br>
        - A section has two main ideas (first and second subject).<br>
        - B section is a development of the first subject.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Texture</h3>
    <p>
        - Polyphonic + contrapuntal.<br>
        - The movement begins in a fugal style.<br>
        - The subject in the solo violin is followed by an answer in the flute at a distance of two bars. We now have
        two-part imitation.<br>
        - There are then four additional bars before the harpsichord left hand enters with the subject, which is then
        answered two bars later by the right hand.<br>
        - The harpsichord plays in two-part counterpoint.<br>
        - Once both hands are playing the music is in four-part counterpoint.<br>
        - Occasionally the flute and violin sometimes double each other in unison (e.g. bar 33).<br>
        - The bassline for the new middle section theme has a tonic pedal on B.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Melody</h3>
    <p>
        - Much of the music is in conjunct style, though there are leaps (e.g. fourths in bar 1).<br>
        - Often the conjunct music is extended to scalic runs, especially in the harpsichord part.<br>
        - Rising sequence at bar 137.<br>
        - Occasional ornaments, with trills in the harpsichord part.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Harmony and Tonality</h3>
    <p>
        - The music is in D major.<br>
        - This key is used for most of the two A sections.<br>
        - The B section modules to the dominant (A major) and relative minor (B minor).<br>
        - The music is diatonic.<br>
        - The harmony uses the standard chords of the time (I, IV and V, with occasional use of ii vi) including
        dominant sevenths in various inversions.<br>
        - The harmony is functional: it uses mainly root position and first inversion chords.<br>
        - Perfect cadences announce the end of sections.<br>
        - Suspensions are used occasionally (i.e. 9-8 suspension at bar 130).
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>TRaM</h3>
    <p>
        - The metre is 2/4 (duple time) but could also be in 6/8. It is essentially a Baroque gigue.<br>
        - The harpsichord part in particular has many semiquaver runs.<br>
        - It uses triplets and dotted rhythms throughout.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Beethoven Pathétique 1st Movement</h2>
    <h3>Context</h3>
    <p>
        - In the classical period, the harpsichord was replaced by the piano.<br>
        - The decline in use of the continuo as the middle-range instruments such as clarinets and horns were used in
        the orchestra to fill out the harmonies.<br>
        - More instruments were added to the standard orchestra. The symphony rose to prominence as the main type of
        concert music played by
        these increasingly large orchestras.<br>
        - Ludwig van Beethoven was born in 1770 in Bonn (west Germany). As a young man he moved to Vienna, where he
        became a virtuoso pianist.
        ‘Virtuoso’ means displaying skill and agility in difficult music.<br>
        - Beethoven was a crucial figure in the transition between the Classical and Romantic periods of music history.
        His music is often seen as
        embodying the ideals of the Romantic period, such as emotional expression and individualism.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Structure</h3>
    <p>
        - The first movement is sonata form, a structure used in the first and sometimes last movements of sonatas,
        symphonies and other Classical works.<br>
        - Sonata form is intro → exposition (1st (tonic key) and 2nd, (dominant key) subject) → development (builds on
        exposition) →
        recapitulation (1st, tonic and 2nd, also tonic subject) → coda.<br>
        - The movement begins with a slow introduction, which is not typical of sonata form.<br>
        - When the exposition is entered a chromatic scale is played.
        <ul>
            <li>Slow intro (bars 1-10).</li>
            <li>Exposition 1<sup>st</sup> subject, fast (bars 11-50).</li>
            <li>Exposition 2<sup>nd</sup> subject - Long High Notes (bars 51-132).</li>
            <li>Repeat exposition, end is alternating high-low chords and a pause.</li>
            <li>Development (bars 133-194): slow intro repeats at the start, but in a different key.</li>
            <li>Recapitulation (bars 195-294).</li>
            <li>Coda (bars 295-end): goes to intro again, ends with basically slamming the piano.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Sonority</h3>
    <p>
        - When Beethoven wrote this piece at the end of the 18th century, the piano had almost completely replaced the
        harpsichord as the
        keyboard instrument of choice for the home and concert hall.<br>
        - It was known as the fortepiano. ‘Piano’ is the Italian term for ‘soft’. ‘Forte’: ‘loud’. It was now possible
        to play using all kinds
        of dynamic levels just by altering the pressure of the fingers on the keys. This was not possible on the
        harpsichord.<br>
        - Mozart and Haydn had started to use dynamic markings, but Beethoven was one of the first to make extensive use
        of all kinds of dynamic possibilities.<br>
        - This sonata has frequent crescendos, diminuendos and numerous other performance markings.<br>
        - The sustaining pedal was coming into use at the time and was sometimes worked by the knees instead of by the
        foot. This was not notated
        but Beethoven would have followed some kind of system in his performances.<br>
        - The piano part is virtuosic, with wide leaps, fast scales and arpeggios, and dramatic dynamic contrasts.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Melody</h3>
    <p>
        - The music of the slow intro is based on a six note motif. It’s used as a base for most of the intro, sometimes
        reduced to five notes,
        and sometimes with the second to last note rising instead of falling.<br>
        - There are a number of scalic passages, such as the descending chromatic scale at the end of the intro. The
        first subject theme from bar 11
        of the allegro is built on an ascending scale of the tonic key C minor, but with a major third (E). There is a
        distinctive augmented second from Ab to B#.<br>
        - Arpeggios and broken chords (bars 29-30).<br>
        - Ornaments are an important feature of the 2nd subject in particular. These include acciaccaturas at bar 53,
        mordents shortly after, and trills just before the recap.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>TRaM</h3>
    <p>
        - The introduction is marked grave (very slow). The time signature is common time.<br>
        - Dotted rhythm is an important feature of the piece (e.g. bar 1).<br>
        - There are some very rapid notes, including septuplets and 1/128th notes in bar 10.<br>
        - The main allegro di molto e con brio (very fast with vigour) section is in cut time – a fast two in the
        bar.<br>
        - Continuous quavers are a distinctive feature of the accompaniment of the first subject.<br>
        - Staccato crotchets are important in the right hand of the first subject.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Texture</h3>
    <p>
        - The slow introduction includes many passages of homophonic (chordal) writing (e.g. bar 1).<br>
        - The right hand plays in octaves later in the introduction (e.g. bar 5).<br>
        - There is a long descending monophonic passage in the right hand leading into the recapitulation (187-194).<br>
        - The second subject material features melody and accompaniment style – you can also call this homophony (or
        melody-dominated homophony [deja vu]).<br>
        - There are examples of two-part music with broken chords in the second idea of the second subject (e.g. bar
        93).<br>
        - There is a brief passage in thirds where the trills are (e.g. bars 181–187).
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Harmony</h3>
    <p>
        - The music features many chromatic chords, especially diminished sevenths (e.g. half way through bar 1).<br>
        - Perfect cadences at the end of the movement.<br>
        - Interrupted cadence in the introduction at bar 9.<br>
        - Circle of fifths bars 244 - 249.<br>
        - Augmented 6th chords, e.g. bars 30 and 34.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Tonality</h3>
    <p>
        - C minor tonality.<br>
        - Modulates to a number of related keys, including E♭ major (the relative major key) and the subdominant (F
        minor).<br>
        - Modulates to unrelated keys such as E minor at the beginning of the development section.
    </p>

        - Music for a While is the 2nd of 4 movements written as incidental music for John Dryden’s play based on the
        story of Sophocles' Oedipus.<br>
        - The Odepius legend comes from Greek mythology and is a tragic story about the title character killing his
        father to marry his mother before
        committing suicide in a gruesome manner.<br>
        - This song features the character Alecto, a goddess whose job was to punish those who had committed sins,
        specifically the crime of
        killing a parent. She was a terrifying Medusa-like creature who had snakes for hair, a dog’s head, bat’s wings,
        blood dripping from her
        eyes and was armed with a whip. In this aria, it is the music which calms Alecto until she drops her whip and
        the snakes fall from her head.<br>
        - Music for a While is a lament. It has falling phrases, minor keys, and slow tempo. (Look at ‘wond’ring’
        [10-11] or ‘drop’ [23-26).<br>
        - The opening bars in the harpsichord also feature falling phrases [1].

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li data-line-start="0" data-line-end="1">Ground bass (basso ostinato) structure. This
                is a short, recurring pattern in the bass part that acts as the principal structural element, whilst
                melodic parts above change. It was a common device in the Baroque period and Purcell used this technique
                extensively.</li>
            <li data-line-start="1" data-line-end="8">Features of the ground bass in ‘Music for a
                While’ include:
                <ul>
                    <li data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3">3 bars long.</li>

                    <li data-line-start="7" data-line-end="8">At the end of the ground there is a
                        characteristic fall of an octave. It sounds incomplete with chord V but a sense of perfect
                        cadence is achieved with chord I at the start of the next repetition of the ground bass.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9">The ground bass is heard 4.5 times in the

                there is a sense of forward looking by Purcell with signs of what was to become the popular
                <strong>ternary form da capo aria</strong> structure used in operatic arias late in the Baroque period.
                This is seen at bar 29 where there is a reprise of material from the opening in identical form with just
                slight extension to conclude the work.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Sonority</h3>
    <p>
        - Soprano, harpsichord, bass viol.<br>
        - Written for a countertenor and continuo, but in the score (the official edexcel one) it is scored for soprano,
        harpsichord and bass viol.<br>
        - The right hand of the harpsichord part is highly decorative. This would have originally been improvised rather
        than notated.<br>
        - Chords are frequently arpeggiated or spread rapidly from the lowest highest note (e.g. bar 13).<br>
        - The left hand of the harpsichord plays the ground bass. The ground bass is also played by the bass viol.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Melody</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Soprano line: Range of a 9th. </li>
            <li>Mostly conjunct. </li>
            <li>Passing notes are frequent (b5:4). </li>
            <li>Leaps are small and no greater than a perfect fourth (b7). </li>
            <li>Rests are used to break up phrases. </li>
            <li>Some descending sequences (b20). </li>
            <li>Extensive use of ornaments in both the soprano line and the right hand of the harpsichord: <ul>
                    <li>Trills (b13) </li>
                    <li>Appoggiaturas (b35) </li>
                    <li>Grace notes (b6) </li>
                    <li>Upper mordents (b22) </li>
                    <li>Lower mordents (b1) </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Mainly syllabic following speech rhythms. </li>
            <li>There are paired slurrings (e.g. bar 5). </li>
            <li>Repetition: ‘Music’ at the start, and ‘drop’ sung nine times in bar 23. </li>
            <li>Word-painting: Music that reflects the literal meaning of a song: <ul>
                    <li>‘Pains’ in bar 12 features dissonance (E vs D). </li>
                    <li>‘Pains were eas’d’: dissonance and resolution on ‘eas’d’ as it falls in a descending sequence.
                    </li>
                    <li>‘Drop’ is presented in a descending sequence and repeated 9 times, bars 23-25. This represents
                        the snakes dropping from Alecto’s head. </li>
                    <li>‘Wond’ring’ in bar 10: a wistfully descending legato melismatic melody. </li>
                    <li>‘Eternal’ in bar 20: a long melisma with repetitive alternating notes. </li>
                    <li>‘Free the dead’: bright G major key with rising melodies (bars 16-17). </li>
                    <li>Minor key suits the sombre nature of the play and the text.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Texture</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>The texture is melody and accompaniment - melody dominated homophony. </li>
            <li>The accompaniment is provided by the ground bass in the left hand of the harpsichord and the bass viol.
            </li>
            <li>The right hand of the harpsichord provides some counterpoint with the vocal line.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Harmony</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chords are diatonic and functional. </li>
        <li>Perfect cadences are achieved from the end of chord V at the end of the ground bass to the chord I at the
            start of the next playing of the ground bass (b3-4). Ic-V-I cadential 6- 4 </li>
        <li>Suspensions are used very occasionally (4-3 suspension in bar 3 beat 4.5 in the harpsichord part). </li>
        <li>Dissonances are infrequent but examples can be seen on the word ‘pains’ in bar 12 with a D in the bass
            against and E in the voice and on the word ‘eas’d’ in bars 13-14 where there is dissonance followed by
            resolution at the start of each repetition of the word. </li>
        <li>Another type of dissonance used is false relation, which can be seen in bar 1 with an F# in the ground bass
            and an F in the right hand of the harpsichord.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Tonality</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A minor tonality with a Pierce de Picardie at the end. </li>
        <li>The tonality, however, is sometimes ambiguous due to the chromatic and non-diatonic nature of the ground
            bass. </li>
        <li>The central section modulates to closely related keys. These include E minor (b14), G major (b16), C major
            (b21), A major (b23), and E minor again (b27). </li>
        <li>The music returns to the tonic key of A minor in bar 28 until the end. </li>
        <li>Modulations are confirmed by perfect cadences.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>TRaM</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>No tempo indication but slow would be appropriate. </li>
        <li>The metre is 4/4 quadruple time. </li>
        <li>A wide variety of rhythms but quavers and semiquavers are the most predominant. </li>
        <li>Dotted rhythms sometimes used in the vocal part (bar 10) but used more in the right hand part of the
            harpsichord. </li>
        <li>Occasional syncopation (e.g. b20) and off-beat rhythms (e.g. b24). </li>
        <li>The ground bass is presented entirely in quavers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Context</h3>
    <p>
        - Written by Freddie Mercury and performed by British rock band Queen. Released in 1974 on the album Sheer
        Heart Attack.<br>
        - The song was a breakthrough hit for the band, reaching number two on the UK Singles Chart and gaining
        international recognition.<br>
        - The lyrics describe a high-class prostitute, using clever wordplay and vivid imagery to portray her allure and
        sophistication.<br>
        - The song is known for its distinctive sound, which combines elements of rock, pop, and vaudeville, showcasing
        Mercury's vocal range and the band's musical versatility.<br>
        - The genre is glam rock, which is characterized by its flamboyant style, theatrical performances, and catchy
        melodies.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Melody</h3>
    <p>
        - The piece mainly uses syllabic text setting. <br>
        - Backing vocals mix words with vocalisations like “ooh” and “ba”.<br>
        - The melody is mostly conjunct, with small leaps of 3rds or 4ths, and occasional wider leaps such as a rising
        major sixth
        (bars 6–7) or an octave (bar 62).<br>
        - There are descending sequences in both melody and bass (bars 7–9), and a melodic descent in 3rds (bars
        31–33).<br>
        - The bassline ascends at times (bar 18).<br>
        - The guitar solo (bar 44) develops earlier melodic material (bars 20–21), while the three-part bass guitar solo
        (bar 55)
        expands on the 2nd verse phrase.<br>
        - There is imitation between guitars (bar 83), and instruments gradually drop out after bar 50.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Harmony and Tonality</h3>
    <p>
        - Overall key: Eb major (opening feels C minor; ends on Eb).<br>
        - Frequent short modulations with perfect/imperfect cadences and occasional circle-of-fifths progressions.<br>
        - Use of sevenths and extended/altered chords (gives theatre/pop colour); mostly root-position with some inversions and tonic pedals.<br>
        - Cadential points guide modulations (e.g. to Bb or C minor); piece fades on Eb.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Structure</h3>
    <p>
        - Verse–chorus based: intro → V1 → C1 → instrumental → V2 → C2 → guitar solo → V3 → C3 → outro.<br>
        - Repeating chord sequences and clear sectional returns.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Sonority</h3>
    <p>
        - Lead vocal, piano (honky-tonk), multiple electric guitars, bass, drums; heavy studio overdubbing and effects (flanger, reverb, panning).<br>
        - Guitar techniques and EQ/production effects contribute to the distinctive timbre.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Texture</h3>
    <p>
        - Mostly homophonic with gradual layering; chorus features multi-part vocal harmonies.<br>
        - Occasional imitation and antiphonal exchanges; three-part texture during guitar solo.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>TRaM (Tempo, Rhythm and Metre)</h3>
    <p>
        - Moderato, swung 12/8 feel (approx. dotted crotchet = 112).<br>
        - Syncopation, triplets and occasional bars of 6/8; verses/choruses often start with anacrusis.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Key Points</h3>
    <p>
        - Riff-driven, anthem-like rock with musical-theatre touches and rich studio production.<br>
        - Compound metre, verse–chorus form, strong vocal harmonies and layered instrumentation.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Verse 1</h3>
    <p>
        - Syllabic vocal line centred around C/G (C minor relation).<br>
        - Staccato verse feel.<br>
        - Backing “ba” vocals and rising major-6th leaps.<br>
        - Ends with cadential moves into the chorus.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Chorus 1</h3>
    <p>
        - Bold harmonies and multi-tracked vocals.<br>
        - Chording often on each beat.<br>
        - Strong panning/effects.<br>
        - Extended falling progressions leading into the instrumental bridge.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Verse 2</h3>
    <p>
        - Similar to Verse 1 with added percussion fills.<br>
        - New guitar figure and intensified backing vocal hooks.<br>
        - Some vocal variation and textural drops.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Guitar Solo / Later Sections</h3>
    <p>
        - Guitar solo develops earlier material.<br>
        - Later choruses repeat established harmonic and vocal textures.<br>
        - Leads to an outro that fades on Eb.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Defying Gravity</h2>
    <h3>Context</h3>
    <p>
        - ‘Wicked’ was written as a novel in 1995 by American author Gregory Maguire.<br>
        - Offers a new perspective on the characters from ‘The Wizard of Oz’.<br>
        - Turned into a book musical, where the musical numbers are integral to the plot.<br>
        - ‘Defying Gravity’ appears at the end of Act 1 when Elphaba discovers that the Wizard of Oz 
        is not the heroic figure she had originally believed him to be, he does not have magic. She vows to do 
        everything she can to fight him and his sinister plans.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Melody</h3>
    <p>
        - The melody mostly follows how the characters in the song are singing.<br>
        - The signing is syllabic, where each note corresponds to one syllable.<br>
        - Vocalisations at the end in bar 175 to the word ‘aah’.<br>
        - The melody starts in a conjunct/stepwise manner.<br>
        - Bars 6 and 7 show an ascending sequence.<br>
        - The verse and chorus combine conjunct and wide angular leaps in the melodic line.<br>
        - Leaps often feature a rising perfect fifth (bar 34).<br>
        - Some exceptionally large leaps such as a compound perfect fourth (compound = above the next octave) (bars 39-40) and a compound perfect fifth (bars 140-141).<br>
        - Leitmotif: ‘Unlimited’ uses the same 7 notes from ‘Somewhere over the Rainbow’, changing the rhythm. Includes Motif X (unlimited), Motif B, Motif C and Motif D.<br>
        - Elphaba sings a semitone lower than Glinda to help convey her anger, since she feels betrayed.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Harmony</h3>
    <p>
        - The voice sings in harmony with the melody, but the melody mostly seems like a backing to the voice. Occasionally the voices sing together and are in harmony with each other.<br>
        - Chords are in root position.<br>
        - Chord progressions are often unrelated and in the opening we can see shifts downwards in parallel semitones.<br>
        - There is some use of dissonance (30).<br>
        - At the end there is a pedal (long, sustained note) (168).
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Tonality</h3>
    <p>
        - It sounds sad (minor) when the voices are sad, but happy when they are happy (major).<br>
        - Tonally ambiguous opening with chromatic movement and unrelated chord progressions.

    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Sonority</h3>
    <p>
        - Large orchestral-pop arrangement: solo voice(s), 4 strings, double bass, woodwind, brass, 2 electric guitars, harp,
         keyboards, extensive percussion and timpani, plus choir at the end.<br>
        - Vocal: Elphaba/Glinda alternate between spoken-sung and fully sung parts; wide range (~2 octaves).<br>
        - Key textures/effects: brass fanfares, string tremolo, pizzicato passages, synths/glockenspiel arpeggiating quavers, tubular bells for ethereal colour.<br>
        - Guitar processing: distortion, chorus, flange, wah, E‑bow for sustained sweeps, palm muting and strong vibrato.<br>
        - Percussion-heavy with many colouristic sounds (chimes, bell tree, shaker, tam‑tam, crotales, maraca, nut rattle, suspended cymbal) and timpani pedal glissandi.<br>
        - Important moments: full band climax ~bar 135; cymbal roll and other hits highlight key changes; specific articulations/mutes (trumpet straight mute, hand‑stopped horns) alter timbre.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Texture</h3>
    <p>
        - The intro has a sparse texture, since some of it is monophonic and it has instrumental chord stabs (bar 1).<br>
        - There is a melody-dominated homophony (where the accompaniment follows the lead of the melody) texture, 
        where the singer is accompanied by chords in the orchestra, mostly at the intro where the cymbals crash between phrases.<br>
        - Homophonic chordal moments (bar 132).<br>
        - Ostinato accompaniment at bar 88 with repeated semiquavers.<br>
        - Elphaba and Glinda usually sing separately but sometimes sing together in unison (bar 101) or in harmony such as thirds (bar 127).<br>
        - Ending: Contrapuntal with three different musical ideas with different lyrics.
    </p>
    <h3>TRaM</h3>
    <p>
        - The song has a slow tempo, and is in 2/2, but the beginning is in 3/2. Verse 1 is in common time.<br>
        - Rallentandos are used at the end of sections. Ralls are usually followed by <i>a tempo</i>.<br>
        - Time signature changes from 3/2 to 2/2 in the opening section, changes to 4/4 in bar 88 and 2/2 in 115.<br>
        - Syncopation is frequent (67-70).<br>
        - Dotted rhythms are present in bar 82 (gra-vi-ty).<br>
        - Triplets: Quaver triplets (96) and crochet triplets (60).<br>
        - Crochet and quaver rhythms, longer note lengths at the end of phrases.<br>
        - Rests used to break up phrases.<br>
        - Phrases start with an off-beat entry after a crotchet rest (15).

    <h1 class="rainbow">Welcome to the AQA's Basement website!</h1>
    <p>AQA's basement is a community of GCSE and A-Level students revolving around a discord server 
    who help each other revise and discuss their exams.</p>
    <p>This website is very much a basic layout/in-development website at the moment, so feel free to contribute!
    It has a long way to go and any help is appreciated.</p>
